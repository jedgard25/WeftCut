  // drag-and-drop handlers, terminating instead in the timeline's own drag-commit
  // path — and it exists mainly for its last two assertions. Whether the source
  // lane really disappears is the defect's own signature (a no-op prune passed
  // every unit test in this repo for as long as it existed), and whether the
  // gesture stayed ONE history entry is the cheapest guard against it quietly
  // decomposing back into add-track-then-move.

  // The drag is DIAGONAL, and that is the third property: a raise carries a
  // landing, so the clip has to arrive where the pointer left it. This is the
  // only gate that watches horizontal travel survive the whole chain — the
  // ghost's arithmetic, the wire's `anchor_layer_id` + `t_start_us` pair, and
  // the mutation's shift — into the project the app actually holds.
