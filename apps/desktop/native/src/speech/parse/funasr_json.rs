//! sherpa-onnx-offline (FunASR Paraformer) JSON → [`Transcript`], with exact
//! per-token (Mandarin: per-character) timing, cut into readable cues.
//!
//! ## Wire contract with the sherpa-onnx-offline sidecar
//!
//! `sherpa-onnx-offline` prints ONE JSON object **to stdout** per input WAV (the
//! wav filename and progress/RTF logs go to stderr), so the sidecar captures
//! stdout verbatim and hands it here untouched — no unit conversion in the
//! backend. This path is NOT runnable in CI, so the schema below is pinned by a
//! committed capture of a real run ([`SAMPLE_LONG`]), exactly as
//! `whisper_json.rs` pins whisper.cpp's.
//!
//! The object is `OfflineRecognitionResult::AsJsonString`. We read only the four
//! fields we need (`text`, `timestamps`, `tokens`, optional `durations`) and
//! ignore the rest (`lang` is read best-effort; `emotion`, `event`,
//! `ys_log_probs`, `words`, `segment_*` are ignored):
//!
//! ```json
//! { "text": "对我做了介绍",
//!   "timestamps": [0.00, 0.32, 0.64, 0.96, 1.20, 1.52],   // SECONDS
//!   "tokens": ["对", "我", "做", "了", "介", "绍"] }
//! ```
//!
//! - `timestamps[i]` is the ONSET of `tokens[i]`, in **seconds** (sherpa prints
//!   them `std::fixed` at 2 decimals). We multiply by 1_000_000 to reach the
//!   microseconds the rest of the pipeline uses.
//! - `tokens` align 1:1 with `timestamps`. Paraformer-zh models Chinese per
//!   character; Latin arrives as BPE pieces marked by a `@@` SUFFIX (`ye@@`,
//!   `ster@@`, `day`). [`build_words`] merges those back into whole words,
//!   because the marker never appears in the engine's own `text` — a `Word` that
//!   kept it could not be located in the cue text that downstream word-span
//!   alignment searches, and every mixed zh/en cue would lose its timing.
//! - sherpa reports no token END. `durations` is in the schema but comes back
//!   EMPTY for Paraformer-zh, so [`build_words`] infers one and caps it at
//!   [`MAX_TOKEN_US`].
//!
//! ## Why this parser segments
//!
//! sherpa-onnx-offline returns one result per WAV and its CLI has no VAD flag,
//! so the engine hands over a whole clip as a single unpunctuated run — for a
//! five-minute interview, one caption layer holding a thousand characters. Every
//! other backend segments itself (whisper.cpp's `transcription[]`, SRT's cues),
//! so the one-cue-per-segment contract downstream had nothing to work with here
//! and faithfully produced one enormous cue.
//!
//! Splitting on punctuation is not available: the shipped `tokens.txt` holds
//! 8404 entries and not one CJK punctuation mark, so this model cannot emit a
//! sentence break. The signal it does carry is the silence between token onsets
//! — the same quantity a VAD thresholds. Measured against
//! `sherpa-onnx-vad-with-offline-asr` + silero on a 25.8 s mixed zh/en sample,
//! [`MIN_SILENCE_US`] reproduces that binary's segmentation exactly: the same
//! six runs, the same text in each, boundaries inside its speech padding —
//! [`MAX_CUE_CHARS`] then subdivides two of them for readability, and because
//! the caps only ever ADD a break, every boundary the VAD found survives into
//! the cues (which is what the test asserts). It gets there without a VAD
//! model, without a second process, and without the per-token
//! timing that the VAD binary's `start -- end: text` line output discards — it
//! offers no flag to keep them, so routing through it would drop this backend to
//! [`WordTiming::None`] and take caption text-correction down with it.
