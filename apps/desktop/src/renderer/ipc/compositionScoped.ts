// Creation channels that are TOLD which composition receives them.
//
// The main side scopes every creation op by an optional `compositionId`
// (absent = root; `main/state/commands.ts`, `actor.ts` `wireCompositionId`).
// Here that id is a required argument, never a store read: several timeline
// Panels stand open at once and the preview may draw a third composition
// entirely, so "here, in the timeline I am looking at" is a guess — and what it
// guesses wrong is where the user's media lands. The gesture names the
// destination instead (ADR 0053 decision 4): a drop passes the Panel it landed
// on, a shortcut, menu item or Quick Action passes the Panel holding the
// keyboard, read at event time. `null` names the ROOT, which is what the
// unbound timeline row the Dock builds before the first summary is.
//
// A `trackId` was never ambiguous — a track id is unique project-wide, so the
// track alone fixes the destination and the composition rides along as the
// cross-check the actor performs. It still has to be the RIGHT one: naming a
// composition the track does not belong to is refused (`InvalidArgument`),
// which is exactly what a store read would produce for a drop into a Panel
// that does not hold the keyboard.
//
// The unscoped wrappers in `./index.ts` keep their root meaning for callers
// that want the root regardless (the e2e export hooks).
//
// Layer-addressed channels carry no composition: the layer id names it
// (ADR 0052), so nothing here wraps `update_layer`, `move_layer` and friends.
