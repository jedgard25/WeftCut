// The one moment, read and written in a composition's own coordinates.
//
// `playheadStore` holds a single time in ROOT time (ADR 0053 decision 2). This
// module is where that number meets the path a surface reads it through — the
// anchor a Panel was entered through, or the preview's own route to its render
// target. Every surface that speaks a composition's own clock — a ruler line, a
// timecode, a snap target, an edit "at the playhead" — reads through here, and
// every scrub writes back through here. Nothing else may translate on its own;
// a second copy of this arithmetic is how two Panels start disagreeing about
// where the film is.
//
// The arithmetic itself is `render/timeProjection.ts` (pure); which composition
// each Panel shows and how it got there is `compositionAnchorStore.ts`.
//
// PERFORMANCE (`playheadStore.ts` states the tiers): an anchor frame is a walk
// of the summary, so anything on the per-frame path hoists one with
// `useAnchorFrame` and subscribes through `subscribeLocalPlayhead` — never
// resolves a frame inside the callback. N open timelines multiply every
// subscriber the playback loop has, so the cheapest tier that fits is the only
// tier allowed.
