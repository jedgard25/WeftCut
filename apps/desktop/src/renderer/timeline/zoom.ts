// Zoom geometry for the timeline view: the keyboard step, the zoom-out stop,
// and the scroll offset that holds one point of the view still while the scale
// changes underneath it. Pure — the state, the key handler and the `scrollLeft`
// write live in `hooks/useTimelineView.ts`.
//
// Two gestures share this module and differ in exactly one input, the anchor:
// The zoom wheel holds the time under the CURSOR, the keyboard holds the PLAYHEAD
// (a key press has no pointer to hold). Everything else — the bounds, the
// re-anchor arithmetic — is the same on both paths, which is why it lives here
// once instead of twice.
