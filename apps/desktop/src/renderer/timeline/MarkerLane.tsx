/// The project's markers, in a row of their own directly under the ruler.
///
/// A row in the ruler family: it measures TIME, like the ticks above it, where
/// the drop strip below it belongs to the track family. It shares the ruler's
/// row coordinates and its quantised scroll window, so a glyph and the tick
/// under it are the same x forever.
///
/// The lane's EXISTENCE is `markers_visible`. One switch owns the whole row:
/// off, the 20 px go back to the tracks and there is nothing here to read past.
/// The reflow that costs is what the switch is for, and every way to flip it —
/// `M`, the View menu, the Quick Actions strip — is a deliberate act.
///
/// Both halves of the row read that one flag: this lane and `MarkerLaneHeader`,
/// which Timeline renders into the sticky header column. A row that vanished
/// from one column and stayed in the other would slide every header below it out
/// of line with its lane, silently.
///
/// Not a scrub surface. The ruler is the sole one, and it stayed the sole one by
/// giving markers up entirely: two hit regions for one object is what a press
/// here would have to arbitrate, and there is nothing to arbitrate when the
/// glyphs live on exactly one row. That is what pays for the DRAG
/// (`hooks/useMarkerDrag.ts`) — a left-press on a glyph in the ruler would have
/// contested the scrub head-on; here it has one meaning and no rival.

// and a FOOT running right from its base, under the name. Two strokes of ink
// where a filled diamond was, which is what a lane full of an agent's marks
// needs — and the stem states the position outright instead of asking the eye to
// find a rotated square's centre.
//
// It also collapses a whole branch: a diamond had to be nudged right by its
// rotation overhang when it stood in for a too-narrow region, or it painted over
// frames the region does not cover. An L has nothing to nudge. Its left edge IS
// the start, for a true point and a degraded region alike.
