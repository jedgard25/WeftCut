// Main-process manager for native SOFTWARE-decode preview sessions (the
// WebCodecs-blind-format path: ProRes/DNxHD/MPEG-2/VC-1 — no shared-texture
// GPU pool, no proxy). MUCH simpler than previewGpu.ts: each decoded NV12
// frame ships as a plain napi Buffer through the addon's per-stream
// ThreadsafeFunction callback, which we relay straight to the renderer over a
// dedicated `previewSw:frame` channel. No slots, no consumeAck, no timings —
// the callback captures `win`, so routing is automatic (no
// `Map<streamId, webContents>` needed).

/// Open a native SW-decode session. Synchronous on the addon side: returns
/// frame dimensions immediately, and registers the frame callback BEFORE the
/// decode thread spawns, so no early frame is dropped. Frames only start
/// flowing after `requestFrameAtPreviewSw`.
///
/// `lane`/`device` optionally select a HARDWARE copy-back lane (Linux
/// NVDEC/VAAPI, `device` = the DRM node for VAAPI) that rides this SAME
/// transport as software — hw accel, then copy-back to the identical NV12
/// frames. A null `lane` = software decode; the frame contract the callback
/// relays is identical either way.
///
/// `scaleDiv` is the playback-resolution divisor (1 | 2 | 4; null = 1 = full):
/// native swscales each frame DOWN before packing, so a 4K frame crosses this
/// IPC at a fraction of its 12.44 MB. The returned dimensions and every relayed
/// frame report the SHIPPED size — native owns that math.
///
/// `cadenceDiv` selects producer output cadence (null = 1 = every frame).
/// Native skips unselected frames before copy-back/swscale/packing and IPC.
///
/// `outFormat` selects the session's CPU transport format (null = 'NV12'):
/// 'I420P10' opens 10-bit output — the renderer asks for it on the
/// videotoolbox lane for a 10-bit source (issue #10) — and every
/// relayed frame carries the matching `format` tag.
