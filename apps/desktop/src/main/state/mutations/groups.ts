 *  `CrossCompositionSet` refusals stay untouched: a move never crosses
 *  composition, and crossing has a name of its own. It is the mutation ADR 0053
 *  decision 8 reserves, and the one reached by pointing at the Group clip you
 *  can SEE — where `move_layers_to_composition`, which this delegates to, is
 *  reached by naming a composition and a time, or by carrying a clip into
 *  another timeline Panel.
 *
 *  The Group LAYER names the destination, not the composition id — it is what
 *  the user pointed at, and it fixes which placement the landing is measured
 *  from. Members land at `t − group.t_start_us + group.src_in_us`, so they keep
 *  the screen position they had: a clip visible under the Group clip stays
 *  where it looked, and one outside its window arrives outside it, which is
 *  overhang and tolerated in state (ADR 0052 §6). Chosen over landing the set at
 *  the destination's playhead because this is a structural regrouping, not a
 *  paste, and a regrouping that moves pictures is a surprise.
 *
 *  The Group layer is never written — not its `src_out_us`, not its `t_end_us`,
 *  not its lane. Duration autofit is per composition (docs/features.md
 *  § Groups), so a destination that grows changes the OVERHANG of every Group
 *  clip that shows it, the pointed-at one included, and retrims none of them.
 *  Its own lock is not consulted either: a lock protects a layer from being
 *  edited, not the composition it happens to point at — the same reason an edit
 *  INSIDE a Group is not refused by a locked Group clip in the parent.
 *
 *  The three refusals below are the Group CLIP's own. Everything else — the lane
 *  policy, links and transitions, locks, cycles, a negative landing — belongs to
 *  `applyMoveLayersToComposition`, which this hands the resolved landing to. */
