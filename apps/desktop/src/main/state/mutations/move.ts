/** Raise a set of layers onto ONE fresh lane — at the tail of the track vector
 *  (`'top'`, the top of the z-stack) or at its head (`'bottom'`, the bottom).
 *  Returns the new track's id.
 *
 *  Top is the overlay direction (the clip paints over everything); bottom is
 *  the underlay (it paints under the A roll, seen through gaps). The centered
 *  single-lane philosophy is what makes both first-class: with extras above
 *  AND below, the A roll sits in the middle rather than at the bottom.
 *  (ADR 0042 decision 2 named top the only spawn point, when the skeleton was
 *  two lanes and a below entry point was a lie; the single lane reopens it.)
 *
 *  Lives beside `applyMoveLayer` because it is a lane change and nothing else:
 *  the new lane is the destination, not the subject. Z-order is rearranged by
 *  repeating this, and every repetition has to clean up after itself, which is
 *  the rule this file already owns.
 *
 *  `anchor` decides whether the raise is also a MOVE, and it is the whole of the
 *  difference between this op's two entry points:
 *
 *  - `null` — no opinion. Every layer keeps its `t_start_us` / `t_end_us`
 *    verbatim, with no re-snap: an endpoint grid follows the layer's KIND, not
 *    its track, so times that were canonical stay canonical, and a set the
 *    caller never retimed must not drift on the way up. `applyDurationAutofit`
 *    is skipped for the same reason — nothing is added, removed or retimed, so
 *    `max(t_end_us)` cannot move, and running it would fold unrelated duration
 *    drift into this entry. This is the *Move to a new track* command's shape: a
 *    menu has no ghost, so it may not silently name a time the user did not see.
 *  - `{ layerId, tStartUs }` — the drag's landing. `layerId` lands on
 *    `tStartUs`, every other member holds its phase to it, and the whole set
 *    then re-snaps on each member's own lattice. Homomorphic with
 *    `applyMoveLayer` (an ABSOLUTE time, floored as a body at 0) rather than
 *    with `applyMoveLayersToComposition` (absolute, but REFUSED before 0): both
 *    of those are the rule for a move that stays inside one composition, which
 *    is what a raise is. The drop strip resolves the number from the pointer,
 *    which is the only value current enough to compute an absolute time from.
 *
 *  Two same-class layers landing on top of each other is left to `validate`
 *  (`LayerOverlap`), which runs after this inside `commit`. The command's
 *  `enabled` predicate prevents that request up front; re-checking it here would
 *  give one rule two homes to drift between. A landing cannot introduce one the
 *  verbatim raise would not have had: the shift is uniform, so members that did
 *  not overlap before still do not.
 *
 *  Link membership is untouched: `c.links` names layer ids and no invariant
 *  ties a link to a track, so the caller's explicit selection moves and nothing
 *  is dragged along — unlike `applyMoveLayer`, which fans a time delta out to
 *  siblings the caller did not name. The set is one composition's
 *  (CrossCompositionSet otherwise): the lane is minted there. */
