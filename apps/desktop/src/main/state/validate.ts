 *    survives the follow and can never invert), then re-sort the composition.
 *  - **Layer here, `src_us` outside `[src_in_us, src_out_us)`** — HIBERNATING.
 *    Keep the anchor, freeze `t_us`, derive nothing. Hibernation is never stored:
 *    it is recomputed here every commit, which is exactly what makes revival on
 *    re-extend or undo automatic and free.
 *  - **Layer in ANOTHER composition** — leave the marker exactly where it is.
 *    Not a drop condition: the layer is alive, so this can only mean a
 *    cross-composition move failed to carry its markers along
 *    (`moveLinksTransitionsAndMarkers`), and validate then refuses the whole
 *    commit with `MarkerAnchorNotInComposition`. Dropping instead would destroy
