 *  when nothing was found" — re-tuning the threshold against a live preview
 *  must cost no undo steps whichever button the tuning ends on.
 *
 *  The core, not the pause: `pad_us` stays on each side (`pauseCores`), so
 *  speech keeps its breath and a soft word onset the peak window read as quiet
 *  is not clipped off. The split targets the SUBJECT Audio layer and the linked
 *  picture follows through `split_layer_multi`'s own link fan-out, which is
 *  what makes a cut by sound land on the frame the sound is on.
 *
 *  ONE `split_layer_multi` and not a split followed by deletes, because the
 *  whole promise here is a single undo that restores the clip whole. The op
 *  already carries both halves: `at_t_us_list` says where to cut and
 *  `discard_segments` which of the resulting pieces never existed as far as the
 *  timeline is concerned. `ripple: true` is what makes the discard a REMOVAL
 *  rather than a lift — the doomed pieces go to the ripple as one set, so two
 *  adjacent cores close as the one hole they are and everything downstream
 *  moves once (ADR 0062).
 *
 *  The cut list is every core boundary STRICTLY inside the clip. A core that
 *  touches the head or the tail contributes no cut on that side, and that is
 *  not an optimization: there is nothing to cut off at a clip's own edge, and a
 *  split there is refused rather than ignored. The segment is discarded whole
 *  instead — dropping the boundary is exactly what makes a leading or trailing
 *  pause one nominal segment rather than an empty one plus a real one.
 *
 *  Which segments to discard is decided by MIDPOINT against the cores rather
 *  than by counting boundaries. The actor re-snaps every cut onto the target's
 *  grid and SKIPS one that no longer lands strictly inside its segment, so a
 *  boundary pair less than a frame apart merges two nominal segments into one;
 *  a midpoint still names the right piece where an index arithmetic over "two
 *  boundaries per core" would name its neighbour.
 *
 *  A clip whose cores cover it end to end names every segment, and
 *  `parseDiscardSegments` refuses that by design — discarding everything is a
 *  delete, not an apply. The refusal arrives here as the actor's
 *  `InvalidArgument` and is passed straight through: the section shows it
 *  inline and the agent reads the field it names.
 *
 *  So do the ripple's own refusals. They are the planner's, raised pre-write:
 *  a clip on another track that STARTS inside a removed core is
 *  `RippleInsideHole`, a link with members on both sides of one is
 *  `RippleLinkStraddles`, a locked downstream lane is `RippleLockedLayer` /
 *  `TrackLocked`, and a mover landing on something that is not moving is
 *  `RippleCollision`. Each names the layer that blocked. The whole commit rolls
 *  back — the clip comes out UNSPLIT, with nothing recorded — so a refusal is
 *  something to fix and re-run, never a half-cut clip to clean up. */
