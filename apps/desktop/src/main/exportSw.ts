// Main-process manager for native SOFTWARE export-decode sessions — the
// EXPORT-side mirror of previewSw.ts (blind-spot originals: ProRes/DNxHD/
// MPEG-2/VC-1). The addon delivers EVERYTHING in-band on the per-session
// ThreadsafeFunction callback as a tagged `ExportSwMsg` — frames AND the
// rangeEnd/ended/error control signals — which we relay verbatim to the
// renderer over the one dedicated `exportSw:msg` channel; the callback
// captures `win`, so routing is automatic. Never split this into a second
// channel — delivery order is the contract (see `ExportSwMsg` in shared/ipc).
// Unlike previewSw this runs under the exactly-once range contract + credit window
// (decodeRange / returnCredit). The module-level `sessions` Set exists for
// orphan reclaim: ONE export spawns several concurrent sessions (one per phase
// group), so a renderer crash/reload mid-export can leave native threads alive
// with no owner — closeAllExportSw reaps them.
