# Data Model

The project state is the single source of truth, authored by the
single-writer actor in the Electron **main** process (TypeScript,
`src/main/state/`); the Rust core holds no resident copy — it deserializes
the same shapes from the slice it is handed per compute call (audio export,
`project://compiled`, single-media reads). UI, MCP server, and persistence
are all clients of the actor — the struct syntax throughout this doc
describes the shared model, not a Rust-exclusive owner.

## Foundational decisions

### Time: integer microseconds (`i64`)
Precise (1 µs ≪ any frame), fps-independent, integer arithmetic. f64 seconds is exposed only at API surfaces for ergonomics.

### Timeline-field alignment: composition frame
Every persisted layer `t_start_us`/`t_end_us` and the
`composition.duration_us` is on a composition-frame boundary. The actor
snap-rounds (half-up) every TimeUs parameter at the top of each
mutator against `composition.fps`, so UI / MCP / future agents all
produce aligned state without re-implementing the rule. Source-time
fields (`src_in_us`/`src_out_us`) are NOT snapped — they're in the
source media's own time space, and the renderer's
`sampleIndexForPtsUs` naturally handles whatever value lands there.

`transition.duration_us` and marker `t_us` / `end_t_us` are on that grid
too. A transition duration is a whole number of composition frames measured
between two canonical boundaries anchored **at the cut** — backward for the
default overlap placement (the incoming layer's shifted start), forward for
an explicit extend's borrowed tail (ADR 0048) — which is what lets the moved
endpoint stay on the grid *and* keep the `overlap == duration_us` invariant;
at 29.97 / 23.976 a duration derived from the rate alone cannot satisfy both. Requests below half a frame are
rejected, not rounded down: a transition and a region marker each span at
least one frame. Markers being frame-quantized matches Premiere/Resolve,
so a marker dropped mid-frame moves up to half a frame.

Alignment is **structural**, not merely per-mutation. The commit validator
rejects any layer endpoint, `composition.duration_us`, or marker time that
is not `round(i × 1e6 × den / num)` for an integer index on that field's own
grid, so a mutator that forgets to snap fails loudly instead of quietly
persisting a sub-quantum time.

### Two grids: composition frames, and the 48 kHz audio lattice

Visual layer endpoints are on the composition frame grid. **Audio layer
endpoints are on the fixed 48 kHz mix lattice** — `round(i × 1e6 / 48000)`,
~20.83 µs apart — because the mixer already converts `t_start_us` /
`src_in_us` / `src_out_us` to 48 kHz sample frames. Choosing samples makes the
authoring grid and the render grid *literally the same lattice*, so there is no
rounding at the seam: the authoring index is the mixer's sample index.

The rate is a **constant**, not `composition.sample_rate`. That field is read
only as the export target, so it is a delivery parameter — it moves no edit and
is never locked. Raising the video fps used to silently change the available
audio precision; it no longer does.

One function, `gridForLayerKind(kind, fps)` in
`apps/desktop/src/main/state/snap.ts`, picks the lattice, and all three
enforcement sites ask it: the validator's predicate, every mutation snap
(including `move`'s link fan-out), and the load repair. That single seam is not
tidiness — a kind-blind fan-out drags a slipped audio member back onto the
nearest video frame on any unrelated link move, and a kind-blind load repair
does it on *every open*. Both destroy authored sync silently, because a snap
that "succeeds" looks like a no-op.

A frame boundary is exactly a sample boundary at 24, 25, 30, 50, 60 and
23.976 fps (integer samples per frame), so a co-aligned A/V pair is exact
there. At 29.97 and 59.94 it is not — 1601.6 and 800.8 samples per frame — so a
paired audio layer sits on the sample boundary nearest the video frame, up to
~10 µs away. That is where the mixer would have played it regardless; storing it
means the file now says what renders.

`composition.duration_us` stays a frame count in all cases: the autofit rounds
the layer high-water mark **up** to the enclosing frame, so a sub-frame audio
tail is contained rather than clipped.

Audio automation (`gain_db`, `pan`, the audio-role envelopes) quantizes on the
sample lattice at write time too, so an audio envelope is no longer coarser than
the mixer that renders it. Keyframe times remain unenforced by the validator for
the reason below.

Three fields are deliberately outside that rule. `transition.duration_us`
and `transition.extended_us` are *distances* between canonical boundaries,
and at 29.97 / 23.976 a distance is not itself a boundary time — so what is
enforced is `overlap == duration_us` (plus `0 ≤ extended_us ≤ duration_us`
structurally), and canonical participant endpoints then make both whole
frame counts automatically. Keyframe `t_us` is snapped on
write but not enforced: trim and split rebase keys by a delta, and
re-snapping the shifted set would dedupe-merge two keys that landed on one
frame, losing authored data.

Timeline time also starts at **zero**: a layer may not begin before the
origin. This is a bounds rule (`NegativeLayerStart`) kept separate from the
grid rules, because a negative time is usually perfectly canonical —
`-1_000_000` is frame -30 at 30 fps — so reporting it as off-grid would point
at the wrong fix. A move dragged toward the origin stops *as a set*: the
clamp applies to the shared delta, so the earliest member of a link lands on
0 and every other member keeps its spacing, rather than individual layers
being shortened in place.

Off-grid times already on disk **repair on load rather than reject**.
`project_open` reaches the actor through `replace_state`, which runs that
same validator, so a hard rule alone would make any project written by an
older build unopenable. `parseProject` snaps every grid-bound field inside
its single normalize pass — beside the additive-field backfills, one pass in
one place — re-derives each transition duration from the repaired geometry,
and reports what it moved so a migrated project is visible rather than
mysterious. The same pass brings negative starts back: a layer straddling
zero has its start lifted (its visible span is preserved exactly, and it can
collide with nothing), while a layer lying *entirely* before zero is parked
after everything else on its track with its duration intact — lifting that
one would collapse it onto the head of the track and the "repair" would
manufacture an overlap the project could not open with. The pass is
idempotent: saving a repaired project and reopening it repairs nothing.

The repair report reaches the status log. It is captured during the parse but
emitted only after the workspace commit, because that commit rotates the
per-workspace LogBus — a row emitted where the repair happens lands in the
bus being discarded.

Display format follows the same grid: timecode reads SMPTE `HH:MM:SS:FF`,
NDF (non-drop-frame) at every fps. Project starting timecode is zero, with
no persisted offset. At 23.976 / 29.97 / 59.94 an NDF label therefore spans
more wall-clock time than its digits suggest — a displayed hour is 3603.6 s,
~3.6 s per hour. That is correct NDF counting, not a rounding error, and it
is invisible while reading a *position*: a position makes no claim about
elapsed time.

Where a **duration** is displayed, it does make that claim, so at fractional
rates the wall-clock figure is shown beside the timecode — the export
dialog's range duration and the composition duration / content-end floor in
Settings. Integer rates show one figure only, because the second would be
the same instant twice.

Drop-frame is **declined, not deferred**. DF changes no stored microsecond;
it is purely a relabelling, and its consumers are interchange formats
(EDL / AAF / OTIO / FCPXML) that do not exist here — export writes no
timecode track. Building it would cost a persisted field, a schema
migration, `;` parsing, and skipped-label rejection to relabel numbers that
are already correct. If interchange is ever built, DF and a non-zero
starting timecode are revisited **together**: they share one migration and
one insertion point (`formatTimecode` / `parseTimecode` in
`apps/desktop/src/renderer/frames.ts`, the choke point all 14 timecode
consumers already go through).

Changing `composition.fps` re-snaps every layer's timeline fields
atomically in the same patch transaction.

The **playhead** is the one exception to boundary semantics. Every
boundary entity above (`t_start_us`, `t_end_us`, `composition.duration_us`,
trim handles) is exclusive and may equal `duration_us`. The playhead,
in contrast, is a frame-anchor: it sits on the START of a real,
displayable frame and is clamped to `[0, lastFrameAnchorUs]` where
`lastFrameAnchorUs = max(0, duration_us − frameDurUs)`. The
post-last-frame slot at exactly `duration_us` is unreachable for the
playhead — pressing End in a 10 s 30 fps comp lands at `00:00:09:29`
(the start of frame 299), not `00:00:10:00`. Helper:
`lastFrameAnchorUs` in `apps/desktop/src/frames.ts`. The clamp lives in
the App-level `seekTo` so every UI seek path inherits it once; the
PlaybackEngine's auto-pause parks at the same value so the displayed
timecode and the painted frame agree at the end of the timeline.

### Boundary semantics: which frame a surface shows or stores

Two conventions coexist by design — the mainstream NLE pairing
(Premiere / Resolve / Avid behave the same way):

- **Frame-anchor display.** The playhead at time `t` displays the frame
  *starting* at `t` (half-open `[t, t + 1 frame)`). Parked exactly on a cut
  it shows the incoming clip's first frame; the outgoing clip's last frame
  is one `←` away. At frame-level zoom the playhead draws a one-frame-wide
  shadow to its right (`playheadFrameShadowPx` in `timeline/geometry.ts`)
  to make this visible.
- **Inclusive-out display.** A tool that presents an *exclusive end
  boundary* to the user shows the last frame the boundary KEEPS, not the
  frame past it: a tail-trim drag previews `boundary − 1 frame` in the
  monitor, and "set out point from playhead" stores the *end* of the
  displayed frame so that frame is included.

The one-frame gap between the two conventions is bridged only by the
named helpers in `apps/desktop/src/renderer/frames.ts` — never by a bare
`±1` at a call site:

| Surface | Rule | Helper |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Playhead / monitor display | frame starting at `t` | `displayedFrameStartUs` |
| Playhead upper bound, End key, auto-pause park | start of last frame | `lastFrameAnchorUs` via `clampSeekUs` |
| In point, range start, paste-at-playhead | inclusive; store the playhead value as-is | — |
| Out point / range end set from the playhead | store the displayed frame's exclusive end | `inclusiveOutBoundaryUs` |
| Trim-drag monitor preview | out side shows last kept frame, in side the first | `boundaryDisplayFrameUs` |
| Edit-point navigation (`↑`/`↓`) | park ON the cut (shows incoming frame) | `seekToPrevEdit` / `seekToNextEdit` |
| Attribute panel End field | shows the exclusive boundary's timecode, so Start + Duration = End holds and frame counts match `out − in + 1` editors | displayed as stored |

Interval math *inside* the render and export pipelines (active-set
queries, export tail mapping, ring lookups) legitimately subtracts a
microsecond from a half-open `endUs` where an inclusive query is needed;
those sites are µs-interval arithmetic, not user-facing frame
translation, and each carries its own why-comment. The review rule for
everything user-facing: a new surface that displays a boundary or stores
a time sourced from the playhead picks its row in this table and goes
through the helper — a hand-written `frameIndex + 1` or `endUs − 1` in UI
code is the bug class this section exists to prevent.

Seeking is the time ruler's job alone. A click or drag on the ruler
strip scrubs the playhead, and the ruler is the only surface that does —
clicks in the track body select or deselect clips and never move the
playhead. Seeking and selection are therefore independent: scrubbing
never clears the current selection, and selecting a clip never moves the
playhead. `Timeline.tsx` routes the ruler's pointer gesture through
`beginRulerScrub`; the timeline-root `onClick` is the single
background-deselect, and clip and ruler clicks `stopPropagation` so they
never reach it. (The ruler keeps scrubbing in blade mode — blade only
governs clip clicks.)

### Identity: UUID v7 everywhere
Stable, opaque, time-sortable. Never use array indices for identity — they shift on every insert and break agent-held references mid-conversation.

```rust
type MediaId = Uuid;
type TrackId = Uuid;
type LayerId = Uuid;
type KeyframeId = Uuid;
type MarkerId = Uuid;
type CheckpointId = Uuid;
type OpId = Uuid;
type LinkId = Uuid;
type TransitionId = Uuid;
```

### History: persistent-snapshot tree
Every mutation produces a new `Arc<Project>`. Old `Arc`s stay alive in the history ring. Built on `imbl` (`im::Vector`, `im::HashMap`) so memory cost per edit is `O(depth)`, not `O(state)`.

### Track-based timeline
Layers belong to one track. Tracks are kind-agnostic — any layer kind
can live on any track. **Layers of the same class (video-class vs.
audio-class) must not overlap in time on the same track** — a hard
invariant; agents that violate it get a structured error suggesting
"create new track" or "trim existing." Cross-class overlap on one
track (e.g. a Video and an Audio layer at the same time) is allowed
and is the default for paired AV imports.

## Top-level shape

```rust
struct Project {
    schema_version: u32,
    project_id: Uuid,                             // stable across saves
    metadata: ProjectMetadata,
    compositions: imbl::OrdMap<CompositionId, Composition>,  // keyed by Composition.id; the root and every Group
    root_id: CompositionId,                       // compositions[root_id] is what export renders
    next_group_ordinal: u32,                      // monotonic: the number the next Group takes; never reused
    media_pool: imbl::HashMap<MediaId, MediaItem>,
    audio_roles: imbl::HashMap<AudioRole, RoleMixSettings>,  // per-role mix buses
    settings: ProjectSettings,                    // proxy res, autosave, etc.
}
```

Every composition has the same shape (next section). The root is
`compositions[root_id]`; a Group is another entry, referenced from some
composition's timeline by a `CompositionRef` layer. There is no sub-composition
type — every walk, mutation and validator has one path over one shape
([ADR 0052](adr/0052-link-propagates-group-composes.md) §3). `compositions` and
`root_id` carry no serde default: a file without them is not a project. The
TypeScript twin keys a plain object; Rust keeps an `OrdMap` so the serialised
order is deterministic.

`audio_roles` holds one `RoleMixSettings { gain_db, muted, solo }` per
mixing role. The map is sparse: an absent role resolves to defaults
(0 dB, unmuted, unsoloed) through `Project::role_mix`, so a project that
never opened the Mixer plays every role at unity. The field carries
`#[serde(default)]`, so older `.vproj` files load with an empty table
(every role at unity) without a schema bump. The mixing model itself —
how the bus folds into layer envelopes, how mute/solo gate selection —
is described in [docs/audio.md](audio.md) and [ADR 0023](adr/0023-audio-mixes-by-role-not-track.md).

## `Composition`

```rust
struct Composition {
    id: CompositionId,
    label: Option<String>,    // None on the root and on an unnamed Group (the UI derives "Group N"); always written, `null` on the wire
    ordinal: u32,             // the N in "Group N", assigned at creation and never rewritten; 0 on the root
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
    fps: Rational,            // (num, den) — handles 23.976, 29.97 cleanly
    duration_us: i64,         // auto-fits to max(layer.t_end_us) while !duration_pinned
    duration_pinned: bool,    // explicit user override; cleared by fit_composition_to_layers
    sample_rate: u32,         // 48000 default
    channels: u8,             // 2 default
    color_space: ColorSpace,  // Bt709 default
    background: Rgba,
    tracks: imbl::Vector<Track>,            // 0 = bottom z-stack, last = top
    markers: imbl::Vector<Marker>,
    transitions: imbl::Vector<Transition>,
    links: imbl::Vector<Link>,
}
```

One timeline: settings plus the four collections that live on it. The root
and every Group are instances of this one struct, so the per-composition
rules apply to each alike — duration autofit (ADR 0005), track cleanup
(ADR 0042), the overlap classes, the reserved A/B skeleton, transitions
between same-track layers, links between same-composition layers. A new
Group copies its parent's settings and starts with the skeleton, exactly as
`blankProject` seeds the root.

**Single lattice.** Every composition's `fps`, `sample_rate` and `channels`
equal the root's (`CompositionLatticeMismatch` otherwise): a Group on another
rate would put its `src_*` window on a different grid from the parent's
`t_*`, which is time-remapping under another name (ADR 0052 §5).
`set_composition` on the root cascades those three to every composition;
`width` / `height` may differ per composition (copied at pre-compose, not
editable in v1).

`fps` MUST be rational. `30000/1001 ≠ 29.97`, and ffmpeg cares.

**Group numbering is stored, not counted.** A Group with no `label` is shown as
`Group N`, and `N` is this composition's `ordinal` — taken from
`Project.next_group_ordinal` when the composition is created and never rewritten.
The counter is monotonic and a number is never reused: delete Group 3, make
another, and the list reads 1, 2, 4. Both halves are load-bearing. Numbering off
the live list instead would renumber every Group below the one you just named or
deleted; reusing a freed number would let undo restore a deleted Group next to
the new one wearing its name. The ordinal is held independently of `label`, so
clearing a name falls back to the number the Group always had, and the root
takes the reserved `0` — it is never shown as a Group. The renderer reads it
through `renderer/lib/layerName.ts`, which owns the one name a Group appears
under; main stores no localized string.

`duration_us` follows `max(layer.t_end_us)` bidirectionally — growing on adds, shrinking on deletes / inward trims — until the user pins it by calling `set_composition { duration_us }`. While pinned, only an overflow guard moves the value (a new layer extending past the pinned duration still bumps it up; the pin stays set). `fit_composition_to_layers` clears the pin and snaps duration to the live high-water mark. See ADR 0005.

## `MediaItem`

```rust
struct MediaItem {
    id: MediaId,
    label: Option<String>,
    path_abs: PathBuf,                // computed at load = workspace.join(path_rel)
    path_rel: Option<PathBuf>,        // authoritative; relative to workspace root
    kind: MediaKind,                  // Video | Audio | Image (subtitle files are consumed at import)
    metadata: MediaMetadata,
    decode_route: DecodeRoute,        // where preview and export each read their pixels; see below
    waveform_path: Option<PathBuf>,
    conform_path: Option<PathBuf>,    // canonical 48 kHz PCM (VCONF); see docs/audio.md
    thumbnails_dir: Option<PathBuf>,
    file_hash_blake3: String,         // for relink-by-content + cache key
    file_size: u64,
    file_mtime: u64,
    imported_at: Timestamp,
}

enum DecodeRoute {
    // Preview and export both read the original source directly; no proxy is generated.
    Bypass,
    // Export reads the original source; preview reads a 720p short-GOP quick proxy.
    // quick_proxy is None until the derivative lands.
    DirectExport { quick_proxy: Option<PathBuf> },
    // Preview reads the quick proxy; export reads the source-resolution export master.
    // Both Option fields represent readiness: None = derivative not yet generated.
    Proxied {
        quick_proxy: Option<PathBuf>,
        full_proxy: Option<PathBuf>,
        format_version: u32,          // bump forces proxy regen on next load
    },
    // A WebCodecs-blind source (ProRes today) that a native libavcodec
    // software decoder can preview directly. Carries the same readiness
    // fields as Proxied so the experimental toggle being off previews via
    // the proxy with no regression; toggle-on overlays the native original.
    NativeSw {
        quick_proxy: Option<PathBuf>,
        full_proxy: Option<PathBuf>,
        format_version: u32,
    },
}
```

`path_rel` is the on-disk anchor (workspace-relative, e.g. `Media/clip.mp4`). On load, `io::load_from_dir` rewrites `path_abs = workspace.join(path_rel)` so workspace moves between machines don't break references. `path_abs` is the in-memory convenience path consumed by the IR compiler + background jobs. If `path_rel` is missing (legacy v1 project before migration) or the resolved file doesn't exist, the pool item gets a "missing media" badge — the project still loads.

`decode_route` is the **persisted source of truth** for where preview and
where export each read their pixels (ADR 0009, ADR 0028; see also
[`CONTEXT.md`](../CONTEXT.md#decode-routing) for canonical term definitions).
The route is decided per source on two axes: whether the export worker can
decode the original directly and whether the original scrubs acceptably as a
preview source. The four legal routes, all represented by distinct variants:

- **`Bypass`**: a friendly short-GOP H.264 source; no proxy generated —
  preview and export both read the original.
- **`DirectExport { quick_proxy }`**: export reads the original at full
  quality; preview reads a 720p short-GOP quick proxy. `quick_proxy` is
  `None` until the derivative lands.
- **`Proxied { quick_proxy, full_proxy, format_version }`**: a source
  WebCodecs cannot decode directly (non-H.264-family codec, or 10-bit/HDR)
  — preview reads the quick proxy; export reads the source-resolution
  export master (`full_proxy`). Both fields are `None` while the respective
  derivative is pending. `format_version` forces proxy regeneration when bumped.
- **`NativeSw { quick_proxy, full_proxy, format_version }`**: a WebCodecs-blind
  source (ProRes today) that a native libavcodec software decoder can
  preview directly. Fields mirror `Proxied` exactly. With the experimental
  `experimental_native_sw_decode` AppSettings toggle off, preview reads
  `quick_proxy` just as `Proxied` would; with the toggle on, preview reads
  the original via the native software decoder (`SwSourceHandle`) instead.
  See [ADR 0029](adr/0029-native-sw-decode-ships-bytes-not-shared-texture.md).

The `Option` payloads express **readiness**: preview is ready when
`quick_proxy` is `Some`, or the route is `Bypass`; export is ready when
`full_proxy` is `Some`, or the route is `DirectExport` or `Bypass`. `NativeSw`
follows `Proxied`'s readiness exactly — the toggle only changes which ready
path preview reads, not readiness itself. The illegal combination — FullProxy
export with Original preview — is unrepresentable by construction.
`resolveDecode(media)` is the single resolver that maps a `DecodeRoute` and
optional session bridge to `{ previewPath, exportPath }`, replacing ad-hoc
flag reads at every call site. See
[ADR 0028](adr/0028-persist-decode-route-as-folded-enum.md).

The static import route is intentionally narrow. H.264 and AV1 8-bit,
browser-friendly sources can be marked DirectExport; HEVC, VP9, ProRes, and
10-bit/HDR sources route to a full export master. The renderer still verifies
DirectExport sources with a real `probeSourceDecodable` key-frame decode before
export. If the probe fails on the current machine, `ensure_full_proxy`
route-corrects the media by transitioning the route from `DirectExport` to
`Proxied` and enqueueing a full proxy, and the export waits for the store to
show a usable path.

Import also runs a session-scoped preview decodability sweep for sources that
would otherwise be blank until a proxy lands. A successful probe lets preview
temporarily read the original via `previewPlaybackPathFor(...,
{ previewDecodable: true })`; this bridge is not persisted and is replaced by
the quick proxy once it exists. `importOptimizeStatus` classifies the same
states as `checking`, `bridged`, `transcoding`, `failed`, `ready`, or `direct`
for every pool entry, and the Media Pool card carries the verdict: a corner dot
while work is outstanding, the codec-named reason in the badge tooltip. It is
informational — the one state that needs the user to act, `failed`, also reaches
the status log, because the pool can be hidden behind another dock tab.

This is a second, orthogonal axis to `mediaReadiness`, which answers "may the
user drag this?" rather than "is a job still running?". The two stay separate
functions: a bridged clip is simultaneously fully usable and still optimizing,
so folding them into one enum would have no state to express it.

On import the clip appears immediately from a stat-only probe (the item carries
a provisional `file_hash_blake3`); a lightweight standalone BLAKE3 pass then sets
the real content hash before any derivative job is enqueued, so jobs are always
keyed on the final content hash and the workspace copy runs in parallel.
(Supersedes the former pending-hash/migrate scheme, ADR 0007.)

### Media kinds & import classification

`kind` is decided at import by `io::probe::detect_kind`, ffprobe-first with an
extension fallback:

- A probed **video stream** means `Video` — except three ffprobe traps. Embedded
  cover art (mp3/m4a/flac/ogg) probes as a video stream with
  `disposition.attached_pic`; those streams are skipped entirely (neither kind
  evidence nor metadata). Still images (png/jpg/webp/gif/bmp/tiff) probe as a
  single-frame video stream; an image-codec stream counts as `Video` only when
  it actually moves with a true video codec (demuxed `nb_frames > 1`, or a real
  duration — think motion-JPEG in an AVI/MOV container). Animated still-image
  formats — GIF, animated WebP, APNG, and animated AVIF — are the third trap:
  they probe as multi-frame but their codec is an image codec (gif, webp, png,
  or av1 in an image container). `detect_kind` uses the `MediaMetadata.container_format`
  field (populated by ffprobe's `format_name`) to distinguish animated AVIF
  (container `avif`) from a true AV1 video stream (container `mp4`/`matroska`
  etc.), and checks the codec name for the other three. All four classify as
  `Image`, not `Video`, so they land as `ImageOverlay` layers with no proxy or
  conform jobs. Motion-JPEG (codec `mjpeg`) in a movie container stays `Video`.
- A probed **audio stream** (and no counting video stream) means `Audio`.
- No probe (ffprobe missing/unreadable) falls back to the extension lists
  below; anything unrecognized defaults to `Video`.

Supported formats per kind — the import dialog offers exactly these, and the
extension fallback recognizes them plus `tif`/`tiff`:

| Kind | Dialog extensions | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Video | mp4, mov, mkv, webm, avi, m4v | Decode routing per the `DecodeRoute` above. |
| Audio | wav, mp3, flac, aac, m4a, ogg, opus | Anything ffmpeg decodes conforms; the VCONF cache is the only contract (docs/audio.md). |
| Image | png, jpg/jpeg, gif, webp, bmp, avif | Rendered from the ORIGINAL with no derivatives. Still images use `createImageBitmap` (single frame, 3 s default duration). Animated formats (GIF, animated WebP, APNG, animated AVIF) decode all frames once via WebCodecs `ImageDecoder` (downscaled to composition size, cached per media) and loop at native speed to fill the layer; a freshly-placed animated image defaults to one native loop. APNG files are named with the `.png` extension. |

**Subtitle files (srt, ass, vtt)** are consumed at import: `import_media` on a
subtitle extension reads the body, parses it through `subtitles::parse`, and
calls `add_caption_track` to land the cues as `Text` layers on a caption-role
track, packing into one already there where it has room (ADR 0070). The
file is never copied to `Media/`, never added to the media pool, and no
`MediaItem` is created. The `MediaKind::Subtitle` enum variant exists in the
Rust codebase but is unreachable through normal import; subtitle files are routed
before the pool-entry path. See [captions.md](captions.md) for the full caption
model (parser, fonts, panel).

TIFF classifies as `Image` when it arrives anyway (drag-drop / MCP take any
path) but Electron/Chromium's `createImageBitmap` cannot decode it — the layer
composites nothing — so the dialog doesn't offer it. SVG is unsupported:
unlisted extensions default to `Video` and won't produce a usable layer.

Derivative jobs follow the kind: `Video` gets decode-route derivatives + waveform +
conform + thumbnails; `Audio` gets waveform + conform only (ready as soon as
the workspace copy lands — no proxy wait); `Image` gets none.

## `Track`

```rust
struct Track {
    id: TrackId,
    label: Option<String>,
    enabled: bool,                    // eye toggle: hides video + silences audio for the whole track
    muted: bool,                      // retained for back-compat load; no longer gates audio (mixing is per-role)
    solo: bool,                       // retained for back-compat load; no longer gates audio (mixing is per-role)
    locked: bool,                     // lock toggle: UI prevents edits; actor rejects structural ops on locked tracks
    removable: bool,                  // false → delete_track refuses; default tracks set this
    transient: bool,                  // not part of the reserved skeleton → cleanup candidate
    role: Option<TrackRole>,          // "a-roll" | "b-roll" | "audio-a" | "audio-b" | None
    height_px: u16,                   // UI display preference
    layers: imbl::Vector<Layer>,      // sorted by t_start; same-class layers never overlap
}
```

Tracks are kind-agnostic — any `LayerParams` variant can live on any
track. The dominant class on a track ("Video", "Audio", "Empty") is
derived from the layers it actually contains.

The live track-header controls are the **eye** and the **lock**. The
eye sets `enabled` — the whole-track gate that hides the track's video
and silences its audio together. The lock sets `locked` (the actor
rejects `move_layer`, `move_layers_to_new_track`, `trim_layer`,
`split_layer`, `delete_layers`, `update_layer`, and
`update_layer_params` on layers that belong to a
locked track, including via link fan-out). Both are toggled through
`update_track_flags`, an **unrecorded** mutation (same
`replace_settings_everywhere` convention as `ProjectSettings` patches)
so undo never flips a track control back.

`muted` and `solo` are **retained on the struct for back-compat load**
but no longer gate audio. Audio mute/solo is now a property of the
mixing **role**, not the track: the per-role `{gain_db, muted, solo}`
in `Project.audio_roles` decides what is audible (see
[docs/audio.md](audio.md) and [ADR 0023](adr/0023-audio-mixes-by-role-not-track.md)).
`update_track_flags` still accepts the two fields so old callers and
projects round-trip, and they continue to deserialize, but the export
and preview mixers ignore them. Audio control therefore stacks in three
scopes: **clip mute** (`AudioParams.mute`, one layer), **role
mute/solo/gain** (`audio_roles`, a whole category of sound), and **track
`enabled`** (the eye — an entire track's picture and audio at once).

A fresh project ships with one non-removable track tagged A-roll — the single
centered native lane. It gives every project a guaranteed drop
target so the UI doesn't have to handle "no tracks exist" as a
separate case, and it gives agents a stable "where do I put this?"
answer when they don't have other context. Users can rename it;
they cannot delete it. `delete_track` returns
`CommandError::TrackNotRemovable` if invoked on one. Additional lanes spawn
above or below it as placement needs them and vanish when emptied. Older
projects may still carry a B-roll lane; `BRoll` stays a valid role.

`label` is `None` on every track a user has not named, and that absence
means **the name is derived** — one rule for the whole track list, with
one exception. A role-stamped track is named from its `role`; a role-less
one from its 1-based slot in the vector, counted from the bottom of the
z-stack, so adding or pruning a track renumbers the ones above it
(Premiere and Resolve do the same). A blank label counts as absent.
Derivation runs **renderer-side** — `renderer/lib/trackName.ts`, the one
answer to what a track is called, called by every surface that names one —
because main holds no locale bundle, so a name computed there could never
be translated, and translatability is the reason the role stamp carries
the name at all. Main emits the same *keys* where it must name a track
without a renderer (`history-labels.ts`), never an English phrase.

The exception is the track `separate_audio` creates, which stores
`"<source> (audio)"` whenever the source has a name of its own: that
records which source the audio was lifted from, and the display layer
cannot recompute it once the layer has moved on.

`rename_track` is the only command that changes the field once a track
exists, and it stores `None` for a blank name — so clearing the rename
field is how a user gets the derived name back. That is the opposite of
the layer rename, where an empty value abandons the edit: a track's
derived name is a meaningful default the user needs a route back to, and a
layer has no equivalent. The inconsistency is deliberate.

Cleanup has one rule: **a track disappears when its last layer leaves
it.** `transient && !locked` is the predicate, and every path that can
empty a track — `delete_layers`, `move_layer`, `move_layers_to_new_track`
and `separate_audio` — calls the same prune with the track it just
emptied, once per distinct track a multi-layer edit emptied. No
preference gates it.

`remove_media --force` is the one deliberate exception: it removes layers
inline and calls no prune, so it can strand an empty track.

`transient` means "not part of the reserved skeleton", so it is stamped
on every track whose `role` is `None` — including one an agent creates
through `add_track`. The invariant is `transient == (role is None)` at
every creation site. `locked` out-ranks cleanup: locking is the user
pinning a row.

The prune is scoped to that one track, never a project-wide sweep. Two
consequences follow. A track that was *born* empty was never emptied, so
a track an agent creates on purpose survives until the agent's own
`remove_track` removes it. And an edit in one part of the timeline can
never make a track vanish in another. Cleanup lands in the same history
entry as the edit that caused it, so one undo restores layer and track
together.

Role-stamped tracks — the A roll, caption tracks, and any B-roll / audio-role
lanes an older project still carries —
survive emptying unconditionally, because carrying a role is exactly
what makes a track non-`transient`. The role, not `removable`, is the
load-bearing discriminant: legacy projects predate `removable` and
deserialize it as `true`.

## `Layer`

Common envelope, kind-specific params:

```rust
struct Layer {
    id: LayerId,
    label: Option<String>,
    t_start_us: i64,
    t_end_us: i64,                    // exclusive
    enabled: bool,
    locked: bool,
    metadata: imbl::HashMap<String, Value>,   // extension point
    params: LayerParams,
    effects: Vec<Effect>,                     // ordered Pixi-filter chain (v1: Blur)
}

enum LayerParams {
    VideoClip(VideoClipParams),
    ImageOverlay(ImageOverlayParams),
    Text(TextParams),
    Motif(MotifParams),
    Audio(AudioParams),
    Color(ColorParams),
    CompositionRef(CompositionRefParams),
}

// A per-layer effect instance. The ordered instances + their animatable
// params are stored here; a catalog outside the model owns which effects
// exist and how to build them. The two join on `kind`, which the model does
// not validate (an unknown VISUAL kind is skipped + warned renderer-side).
// v1 params are scalar `Animated<f64>` only. See render.md, ADR 0027.
//
// Two families share this record. A visual `kind` is a realtime Pixi filter
// from `render/effects/effectRegistry.ts`. A `kind` in the `audio.*`
// namespace is an offline bake of the clip's audio, catalogued in
// `shared/audioEffects/` (ADR 0063) — and it is the one kind-ownership rule
// the command layer enforces: `audio.*` only on an Audio layer, nothing else
// on one (`EffectKindNotApplicable`). Its params are Static ONLY
// (`AudioEffectParamStatic`); the artifact a chain bakes to is derived from
// the effects and never stored on them.
struct Effect {
    id: EffectId,
    kind: String,                             // catalog key, e.g. "blur"
    enabled: bool,
    params: BTreeMap<String, Animated<f64>>,
}
```

### `VideoClipParams`

```rust
struct VideoClipParams {
    media: MediaId,
    src_in_us: i64,
    src_out_us: i64,
    transform: Transform,
    opacity: Animated<f64>,
    crop: Option<Rect>,
    flip_h: bool,
    flip_v: bool,
    blend_mode: BlendMode,
    speed: f64,                       // 1.0 default; warns if != 1 with attached audio
}
```

### `TextParams`

```rust
struct TextParams {
    content: String,
    font: FontSpec,
    color: Animated<Rgba>,
    align: TextAlign,
    transform: Transform,
    opacity: Animated<f64>,
    shadow: Option<Shadow>,
    outline: Option<Outline>,
    intro: Option<TextAnimPreset>,    // FadeIn, SlideUp, Typewriter, ...
    outro: Option<TextAnimPreset>,
    box_w: Option<f32>,               // layout box, composition px, LOCAL (pre-scale)
    box_h: Option<f32>,
    valign: VAlign,                   // Top | Middle | Bottom — the block inside the box
    line_height: f32,                 // 0 = auto (the font's own metrics)
    letter_spacing: f32,
}
```

Preview and export render text through PixiJS `TextSprite` (native canvas text,
shadow/outline filters, intro/outro presets).

Text is the only visual kind with no intrinsic size, and the box is what gives it
one. Which box fields are set **is** the resize mode — there is no mode enum to
contradict them:

| `(box_w, box_h)` | Mode | Wraps | Shrinks to fit |
|---|---|---|---|
| `(None, None)` | Auto width | no | no |
| `(Some, None)` | Auto height | yes | no |
| `(Some, Some)` | Fixed | yes | yes |

`(None, Some)` is not a mode: a gesture that drags a top or bottom edge backfills
`box_w` from the measured width in the same commit, the MCP boundary refuses it
(the state layer has no canvas and so no way to measure), and the renderer
coalesces it to Auto width rather than blanking a frame.

Neither box field is `Animated`, deliberately: a keyframed box would move the
shrink factor every frame and rebuild the glyph atlas with it. `scale_x`/`scale_y`
remain the animation channel for a text layer's size, and they scale the rendered
result — the box lays glyphs out instead of magnifying them. The shrink factor
Fixed applies (and the outline, shadow, leading and tracking scaling that follows
it) is **derived in the renderer and never stored**: an MCP `content` edit never reaches the renderer, so
a persisted effective size would be stale from the next word typed. See ADR 0049.

### `MotifParams`

```rust
struct MotifParams {
    motif_id: String,
    motif_version: u32,
    props: imbl::HashMap<String, Value>,   // validated against the Motif manifest's props_schema
    src_in_us: TimeUs,                      // window offset into the Motif's intrinsic content (0 = content frame 0)
    transform: Transform,
    opacity: Animated<f64>,
}
```

### `AudioParams`

```rust
struct AudioParams {
    media: MediaId,
    src_in_us: i64,
    src_out_us: i64,
    gain_db: Animated<f64>,
    pan: Animated<f64>,               // -1 .. 1
    fade_in_us: u64,
    fade_out_us: u64,
    mute: bool,                       // per-clip mute
    role: AudioRole,                  // dialogue | music | sfx | voiceover
}
```

`role` is the layer's **mix-bus tag** (kebab on the wire:
`dialogue`/`music`/`sfx`/`voiceover`; default `dialogue` via
`#[serde(default)]`). The mixer groups by this, not by track — every
layer tagged `music` shares one bus, wherever its track sits. The bus
settings live in `Project.audio_roles` (below); see [docs/audio.md](audio.md).

### `CompositionRefParams`

```rust
struct CompositionRefParams {
    composition: CompositionId,       // the Group; never root_id, never on a reference cycle
    src_in_us: i64,                   // window into the composition's own time
    src_out_us: i64,
    transform: Transform,
    opacity: Animated<f64>,
    blend_mode: BlendMode,
}
```

A Group layer is a media-bearing layer whose source is a composition
(ADR 0052 §4). Its source duration is `compositions[composition].duration_us`,
and parent time `t` maps to composition time `t − t_start_us + src_in_us`.
That sentence is what lets the kind join `VideoClip` / `Audio` in the
`src_in_us` / `src_out_us` family: trim clamping, split's proportional source
distribution and keyframe re-basing apply verbatim.

**Overhang is tolerated in state and clamped at the gesture** (ADR 0052 §6).
Validation requires `0 ≤ src_in_us < src_out_us` and nothing more — no upper
bound — because a bound would refuse a delete *inside* the Group whenever
autofit shrank its duration under a parent's window. A trim drag clamps
`src_out_us` to the composition's duration; past the end the Group renders
nothing.

The kind is visual, so a Group layer may be a transition participant. Not in
v1: `speed`, `crop`, `flip_*`, a ref-level audio gain. `Layer.effects` applies
as on any layer.

### `Transform`

```rust
struct Transform {
    position: PositionAnimation,      // canvas-pixel position reference
    scale_x: Animated<f64>,
    scale_y: Animated<f64>,
    rotation_deg: Animated<f64>,
    anchor_x: Animated<f64>,          // 0..1 normalized; the transform PIVOT
    anchor_y: Animated<f64>,
    scale_linked: bool,               // uniform-scale intent; default true
}
```

`PositionAnimation` is exactly one of `XY { x: Animated<f64>, y: Animated<f64> }`
or `Path { path: { nodes }, progress: Animated<f64> }` (ADR 0060). A path node
has a stable `id`, `point: {x,y}`, relative `in_handle`/`out_handle` vectors, an
outgoing `segment: Line | Cubic`, and `tangent_mode: Corner | Smooth | Auto`;
geometry contains no timestamps. Corner handles are independent; Smooth keeps
them opposite with independent lengths; Auto derives them from adjacent chords.
The authoring solver stores explicit resolved handles for every reader. Progress
0–1 traverses the path by distance, with temporal easing on that scalar track.
Path progress exposes `path_progress` to keyframe commands and supports
Hold/Loop/PingPong extrapolation; independent `x`/`y` writes are rejected in
Path mode. Geometry-only edits retain progress verbatim. Full position records
frame-snap and solve temporal Auto tangents but retain floating-point value
precision, including baked samples. XY remains the default.

`set_position` replaces the complete record atomically; `translate_path` moves
all nodes by a relative displacement. The UI's `update_path_transform` combines
that displacement with scale/rotation/pivot writes in one undo entry. Splitting
a path retains both the complete route and complete progress on each half,
shifting only the right half's local key times. Displaying an XY trajectory
does not convert it. Conversion previews do not write project state; applying
one is a single complete-record replacement. Shape-preserving insertion splits
the selected span exactly and freezes adjacent Auto nodes as Smooth, retaining
progress. Conversion fits editable cubics and adaptively refines temporal keys
against a pixel error target. Jumping positions are refused; a missed target at
node/key/frame-grid limits disables Apply. Error is measured, not guaranteed
between checks. See ADR 0060 for sampling limits.

The anchor pair is the **pivot**: what `rotation_deg` turns around and what a
flip mirrors about, in normalized layer coordinates (`(0.5, 0.5)` = center, the
default). It is `Animated` like the rest of the transform, so the pivot can be
keyframed — a rotation whose centre travels needs nothing else. The pair is
**unbounded**: a pivot outside the layer's own box is a legitimate authoring
choice. It replaced a single `anchor: [x, y]` tuple pre-release; the load-time
conversion that read that tuple is gone with the formats that carried it (ADR
0047), so v1 knows only the two tracks. The lesson it left behind is worth
keeping, because it is why a conversion belongs in a migration step rather than a
default: the tuple held authored data — ASS `\an` import writes an off-centre
anchor on every caption layer — so defaulting the new fields to the centre would
have re-positioned every imported subtitle. What `x`/`y` mean depends on the
kind, and the difference is deliberate:

| Kind | `x`/`y` is | why |
|---|---|---|
| VideoClip, ImageOverlay, Motif | the **unrotated top-left** | natural size is fixed, so a corner is a stable origin — and it is what stored projects already mean |
| Text | the **anchor point itself**, taken over the layout box | measured text bounds move with the content, so only an anchor-relative origin is stable (ASS `\an` import writes anchor + position together — `subtitles/layout.rs`). With no `box_w` the box degenerates to those measured bounds, which is why Auto width behaves exactly as it did before the box existed |

The media kinds get there by compensating the position for the pivot
(`render/anchorPivot.ts`): the pivot goes at the anchor in texture space and the
position adds `pivot × |effective scale|` back. The absolute value is what makes
a flip mirror **in place** instead of jumping to the other side of `x`. At
`rotation_deg = 0` with no flip, the top-left lands on `(x, y)` at any scale.

That asymmetry decides what *moving* the anchor does, and the two editing
surfaces answer differently — deliberately, matching After Effects:

| Surface | Writes | Effect on the picture |
|---|---|---|
| Inspector `Anchor X`/`Anchor Y` (and MCP / timeline lanes) | the anchor track alone | unchanged for an unrotated, unflipped media layer; **moves** a rotated, flipped, or Text layer |
| The preview's on-canvas target | the anchor pair **plus** compensating `x`/`y`, in one commit | never moves — the pan-behind gesture |

The compensation is `anchorCompensation` in `renderer/preview/gizmoGeometry.ts`,
which is the negation of the anchor-dependent part of the composed position:
`−R·S·q` for the anchor origin and `(|S| − R·S)·q` for the top-left one, where
`q` is the anchor change in local pixels. For an unrotated media layer that term
is exactly zero, so the common gesture writes two tracks, not four, and never
stamps a redundant key on `x`/`y`.

**Scaling** splits the same way, and mirrors it. Because the media kinds' position
adds `pivot × |scale|` back, changing scale alone holds the unrotated **top-left**
still and walks the pivot — which is what the inspector's Scale field does. The
preview's resize handles instead pin the **anchor**, the way After Effects and
Premiere do, by committing `scaleCompensation` = `pivot·(|scale₀| − |scale₁|)` per
axis in the same batch. That term has no rotation in it (the position never had
one), and it is exactly zero for Text — whose `x`/`y` *is* the pivot, so scale
cannot move it — the reverse of the anchor case above.

`scale_linked` records **uniform-scale intent**: while `true`, the two scale
tracks are structural twins — same mode, and when keyframed the same
`(t_us, value, in, out, continuity, segment)` sequence and the same
`extrapolate` (keyframe `id`s are per-track identities and legitimately
differ) — and every editing surface shows and writes them as one
"Scale"; the preview's resize handles do it by offering **corners only**, since a
linked layer has no honest single-axis handle. The invariant is enforced on
**results**, not write paths
(`main/state/mutations/scaleLink.ts`): after any mutation that touches a scale
track of a linked layer, a twin check runs in the same commit and clears the
flag on divergence, so the flag can never lie regardless of which write path
(UI, MCP, or anything else) produced the state. Re-linking (`set_scale_linked
{ linked: true }`) is the one destructive edit: `scale_y` becomes a fresh-id
whole-track copy of `scale_x`, atomically with the flag. The field is additive
on the wire — absent on older saves — and the load pass backfills it from the
twin check (never a blind `true`), which also repairs a hand-edited
`true`-over-diverged-tracks file. Rust carries the field for wire fidelity
only; no compute reads it.

## Animated values

```rust
enum Animated<T> {                           // wire: {"mode":"Static","value":v} | {"mode":"Keyframed","value":[..],"extrapolate":{..}}
    Static(T),
    Keyframed(imbl::Vector<Keyframe<T>>, Extrapolation),   // sorted by t_us; Hold / Hold is the clamp
}

struct Keyframe<T> {
    id: KeyframeId,
    t_us: i64,                               // RELATIVE to layer.t_start_us
    value: T,
    in_: Tangent,                            // wire "in": shape of the segment ARRIVING at this key
    out: Tangent,                            // shape of the segment LEAVING this key
    continuity: Continuity,                  // Smooth | Broken
    segment: Segment,                        // class of the segment LEAVING; only Spline reads tangents
}

struct Tangent { x: f64, y: f64, mode: TangentMode }   // a point in the segment's unit square
enum TangentMode { Auto, Free }
enum Continuity { Smooth, Broken }
enum Segment { Spline, Hold, Linear, Elastic { dir, amplitude, period }, Bounce { dir } }   // wire: tagged by "kind"
enum Extrapolate { Hold, Loop, PingPong, Offset, Continue }
struct Extrapolation { before: Extrapolate, after: Extrapolate }
```

Keyframe times are **relative to the layer's start**. Otherwise moving a layer breaks its animation. Trim and split keep keyframes content-anchored: an IN-edge trim shifts every key by the edge delta, split partitions keys at the cut (right half re-based, an emptied half collapses to `Static` at the boundary value), and keys pushed outside `[0, duration]` are **retained, not dropped** (so trims stay reversible) — `value_at` clamps out-of-range keys and the UI hides them.

A keyframe's shape is two **tangents**, one per side. `out` shapes the segment leaving the key and `in` the segment arriving; each is a point `{x, y}` in the owning segment's unit square — fractions of that segment's time span and value span, the CSS `cubic-bezier` lineage — plus a mode. A Spline segment `a → b` evaluates as `unit_bezier(a.out.x, a.out.y, b.in.x, b.in.y)`. `in` is stored **un-mirrored**: it is the arriving cubic's second control point exactly as the engine consumes it, not the handle the user sees (that sits at `in − (1, 1)` from the key, and the mirroring is the curve graph's presentation only). Exactness is the reason — `1 − (1 − 0.58)` is not `0.58` in f64, and preset recovery, the linked-scale twin compare and the Rust↔TS goldens all rest on exact equality — so there is zero arithmetic between store and engine. The identity sides are `(1/3, 1/3)` for `out` and `(2/3, 2/3)` for `in`, written as the expressions `1 / 3` and `2 / 3` in both languages, never as decimal literals. The first key's `in` and the last key's `out` are stored but read by no segment (the last key's `in` is what `Continue` extrapolation reads).

`mode` is per side. **Free** is the numbers as written. **Auto** is clamped monotone — the slope through the key taken from its neighbours, flat at an extremum, an endpoint or a sign change, `y` clamped to `[0, 1]` so a value never overshoots (Blender's Auto Clamped) — and it is solved when the track is **written**, in the actor's normalization beside frame-snap / sort / dedupe-last-wins, never in the engine: stored tangents are always explicit, so the curve graph, `get_param_track`, the wasm preview and the native export read the same numbers. `continuity` is `Smooth | Broken` and is maintained by that same normalization rather than stored as a constraint: when both sides are Free and both adjacent segments are Spline, Smooth re-derives `in.y` from the out-side's slope ("out wins" — main cannot know which handle moved, and the renderer writes both sides itself on an in-handle drag, so the rule fires only when a neighbour's edit changed the segment's Δv/Δt). Trim, split and move never re-solve; explicit numbers are what keep the motion byte-identical across a cut.

`segment` on the left key names the class of `kf[i] → kf[i+1]`. **Spline** reads the two tangents. **Hold** (left-stick step — no cubic represents it), **Linear** (its own class, so its glyph needs no f64 test against the diagonal), and the procedural **Elastic{dir, amplitude, period}** / **Bounce{dir}** — oscillating curves a single cubic cannot express, evaluated closed-form in the eval leaf, parameters instead of handles — ignore them, and the sides adjacent to such a segment hold the identity. Named easing presets (the CSS eases plus the sine/quad/cubic/quart/quint/expo/circ/back families) are not schema variants: the authoring layer bakes a preset to its canonical `(p1, p2)`, which land as `left.out` / `right.in`, both Free, with `left.segment = Spline`, and recovers the name for display by exact reverse lookup over `(this.out, next.in)` against the append-only table in `src/shared/easing.ts` (params in that table are never retuned — a changed feel is a new id). Applying a preset to `A → B` leaves `B.out` untouched, so an Auto key downstream stays smooth. `Interpolation` in that module names the easing of ONE segment as a value — what the table holds and what `set_keyframe_easing` takes — and `segmentEasing` / `applySegmentEasing` bridge it to the record.

Outside its first and last key a track follows `extrapolate { before, after }`, each `Hold | Loop | PingPong | Offset | Continue`, independent, default `Hold / Hold` (the end value — the clamp). The period is `last.t − first.t`; a single-key track never extrapolates. **Loop** returns to `first.value` at `last + period`, a visible jump when first ≠ last that nothing bridges (After Effects' `loopOut("cycle")`, Blender's Cycles). **PingPong** runs odd periods backwards. **Offset** adds `n · (last − first)` per period in the value type's interpolation space (`Rgba`: OkLab, clamped at the u8 conversion). **Continue** extends a line at the last segment's end velocity; a Hold or procedural last segment gives slope 0.

There is no migration to this record: v1 is redefined in place under § Versioning's pre-release rule, and `parseProject` **refuses** the old shape — a key carrying `interp` or lacking any of `in` / `out` / `continuity` / `segment`, or a keyframed track lacking `extrapolate` — with a named error rather than a default (the additive-field rule: a defaulted tangent is not a blank screen but silently different motion). ADR 0058.

Animatable params, by kind: the visual kinds carry `x`, `y`, `scale_x`,
`scale_y`, `rotation_deg`, `anchor_x`, `anchor_y` and `opacity`; Audio carries
`gain_db` and `pan`; Text adds `color` and Color carries `color` alone. Effect
params are addressed as `effects[<id>].params[<key>]` — except an `audio.*`
effect's params, which are static only and refuse a `Keyframed` track at both
write entries, because an audio effect is a whole-clip offline bake with no
per-frame value to animate (ADR 0063). The list has ONE home per
side — `animatableParams` in `renderer/keyframe/descriptors.ts` and
`TRANSFORM_F64_KEYS` + `f64Lens` / `rgbaLens` in
`main/state/mutations/params.ts`, mirrored by `resolve_animated_f64` in
`native/src/state/layer.rs`. A param missing from the descriptor list has no
stopwatch, no timeline lane and no curve, however writable its track is.

`color` is the one param whose track carries `Rgba` rather than a number, and
the param KEY decides which: a track write picks `rgbaLens` or `f64Lens` from
it, and a value of the other type is refused (`InvalidArgument` on `track`)
rather than coerced. Everything between is shared — snap, sort, dedupe and the
tangent solve are generic over the value — except that quantization is
numbers-only (a channel is already an integer) and the Auto solve runs with no
scalar projection, because a colour has no single axis to take a slope on: its
Auto sides land on the identity coordinates with their mode kept, and the Smooth
"out wins" rule does not apply. A Text layer's shadow and outline colours are
plain `Rgba` fields, not tracks, and stay static by decision; wrapping one in an
`Animated` later is the cheapest class of change and needs no migration.

## `Marker`

```rust
struct Marker {
    id: MarkerId,
    t_us: i64,
    end_t_us: Option<i64>,            // makes it a region marker
    label: String,                    // short name — lane text, Ctrl+K row
    note: String,                     // long text — the marker Panel's field
    color: Rgba,
    anchor: Option<MarkerAnchor>,     // None = a free marker
}

struct MarkerAnchor {
    layer: LayerId,
    src_us: i64,                      // in the layer's SOURCE domain
}
```

A marker belongs to one composition and only ever to one. **Following a clip is
a field, not a second entity**: an anchored marker names a layer of its own
composition plus a time in that layer's source window, and `t_us` becomes a
derived cache that nonetheless stays *stored* — so every reader (the marker
lane, `Ctrl+K`, the summary projection, serialize, MCP, export) goes on reading
`t_us`.

Because `t_us` is the cache, **patching it on an anchored marker moves the
anchor**: `update_marker` takes the time as a statement of where the mark should
read, derives `src_us` from the anchoring layer, and leaves the reconcile in the
same commit to write `t_us` back. A time outside that layer's half-open span is
refused, and `t_us` paired with `end_t_us` is refused too — the reconcile already
carries an anchored region's end by the same frame delta, so writing it as well
would move it twice. `anchor` itself is not patchable at all; it is set and
cleared only by attach and detach.

`label` and `note` split because `label` has two consumers that force it short
(the lane's inline text, the `Ctrl+K` row) — the same split Premiere makes as
Name + Comments and Resolve as Name + Notes.

An anchored marker whose `src_us` falls outside its layer's
`[src_in_us, src_out_us)` window **hibernates**: kept, not painted, and revived
exactly where it was by undoing the trim. Holding the tie in source time is what
buys that; it is a legal state, not a broken project, so `src_us` is deliberately
not range-checked.

## `Link`

```rust
struct Link {
    id: LinkId,
    label: Option<String>,            // omitted on the wire when absent (`skip_serializing_if`), never `null`
    members: imbl::OrdSet<LayerId>,   // ≥ 2; a layer is in at most one link; the TS twin keeps its array sorted to match
}
```

A flat, non-nesting set of layers of **one composition** whose move / trim /
split fan out to every member; nothing else about a link is rendered, mixed
or exported. The
behaviour contract is [features.md § Links](features.md#links). On the read
surface a link is `LinkSummary { id, label: string | null, layer_ids }` —
`links` on `project://current` — where the omitted label becomes an explicit
`null`.

## Read surface: `ProjectSummary`

The renderer never holds a `Project`. It mirrors the read-only view main builds
on every `project:changed` (`main/state/summary.ts` `buildProjectSummary`;
`renderer/ipc/index.ts` declares the same shapes):

```ts
interface ProjectSummary {
  project_id: string; name: string
  root_id: string                                  // compositions[root_id] is what export renders
  compositions: Record<CompositionId, CompositionSummary>
  track_count: number; layer_count: number         // counted over EVERY composition
  history: { cursor, len, can_undo, can_redo, lock_reason? }
  media: MediaSummary[]                            // the pool, availability-gated by fs.existsSync
  audio_roles: RoleMixView[]                       // the 4 roles, canonical order, defaults filled
}

interface CompositionSummary {
  id: CompositionId; label: string | null
  ordinal: number                                  // the N in a derived "Group N"; carried even on a labelled Group
  width: number; height: number; fps_num: number; fps_den: number
  duration_us: number; duration_pinned: boolean
  fps_locked: boolean                              // history-scoped, so project-wide — repeated on every entry
  tracks: TrackSummary[]; markers: MarkerSummary[]; transitions: TransitionView[]; links: LinkSummary[]
}
```

Every composition is projected, keyed by id; the projection of one is a pure
function of that composition (plus the media pool, and the label lookup a
`CompositionRef` layer's view carries as `composition_label`). Timeline fields
live only on the entries — there is no flat `tracks` on the project — so a
consumer names the composition it reads. A timeline Panel names its own
(ADR 0053): its Dock address is `timeline:<composition_id>`, so several can
stand open at once, each drawing one composition. Everything that follows the
keyboard follows the FOCUSED one — `state/compositionAnchorStore.ts`, the
composition of the timeline Panel that last held it: the inspector, the
Playhead panel and every creation channel (`add_track`, `add_marker`,
`add_color_layer`, …, each stamped with the `compositionId` of the Panel that
caused it). The preview is the one surface that does not: it names its own
RENDER TARGET, which is a composition it is locked to or, by default, the
focused one. Export alone is fixed — it reads `compositions[root_id]` and
nothing else, because a Group is a source. That store also holds each Panel's
ANCHOR, the path of `CompositionRef` layers it was entered through; should a
composition vanish from a summary — undoing the pre-compose that created it
while standing inside it — its Panel closes and the focus falls back to the
nearest surviving step of that path, then the root.

`TrackSummary.kind` is a derived class label (Video / Audio), never a name:
`renderer/lib/trackName.ts` is the single answer to what a lane is called
(ADR 0042). `TrackRole` is emitted in kebab form (`a-roll`, `b-roll`,
`audio-a`, `audio-b`, `caption`).

## History

```rust
struct History {
    snapshots: VecDeque<HistoryEntry>,        // bounded ring; default 200
    cursor: usize,
    checkpoints: imbl::HashMap<CheckpointId, NamedCheckpoint>,
    lock: Option<String>,                     // when set, undo/redo/restore reject
}

struct HistoryEntry {
    op_id: OpId,
    actor: Actor,                              // User | Agent { client: String }
    timestamp: Timestamp,
    summary: String,                           // "Moved 'intro' to 4.20s"
    affected_ids: Vec<Uuid>,
    snapshot: Arc<Project>,
}

struct NamedCheckpoint {
    id: CheckpointId,
    label: String,
    actor: Actor,
    created_at: Timestamp,
    snapshot: Arc<Project>,
}
```

- **Undo/redo**: move `cursor`, broadcast snapshot at cursor.
- **Checkpoint**: explicit named snapshot stored separately; survives undo-truncation; persists in save file.
- v1 is linear undo; tree-of-edits is v2 (the snapshot model already supports it — just add parent pointers).
- **Several mutation classes sit outside the undo stack** — see `docs/features.md#undo-stack-scope` for the full per-op table. The pattern: patch every snapshot (and checkpoint) in place via `replace_media_pool_everywhere` or `replaceCompositionEverywhere`, broadcast a non-recorded `ChangeEvent`, cursor unchanged. Covers media imports/removals of unreferenced media, derivative and workspace-path updates, the **entire composition envelope** (`set_composition` / `fit_composition_to_layers`, duration included), and project open/new (`replace_state` resets history instead). Timeline edits and cascade media removals still record normally.
- The composition fan-out is a **transform applied per snapshot**, not a value copied across them: a pinned `duration_us` is floored at each snapshot's own content high-water mark (so an older snapshot never ends up shorter than its own layers), and an `fps` re-snap runs against each snapshot's own markers. Because the write spans every stored snapshot, the `fps` rate lock is judged over them too — see the rate-lock note in features.md.

## Concurrency: single-writer actor

The actor runs in the Electron **main** process (TypeScript, `src/main/state/`)
and is the sole writer; the shape below is illustrative of what it holds.

```rust
struct ProjectActor {
    current: Arc<Project>,
    history: History,
    subscribers: Vec<Sender<ChangeEvent>>,
    inbox: Receiver<Command>,
}
```

```
   UI command (IPC)              MCP tool call
         │                              │
         └──────────► inbox ◄───────────┘
                       │
                  ProjectActor
                       │
        ┌──────────────┼──────────────┐
        ▼              ▼              ▼
   new Arc<Project> history append broadcast
                       │
        ┌──────────────┼─────────────────────┐
        ▼              ▼                     ▼
       UI       IR compiler           MCP change feed
```

- One writer; UI and MCP both submit `Command`s.
- Reads are lock-free (`Arc` clone).
- Bounded inbox (capacity ~100); under sustained agent flood, reject-oldest with backpressure error.

## `ChangeEvent`

```rust
struct ChangeEvent {
    op_id: OpId,
    actor: Actor,
    timestamp: Timestamp,
    summary: String,
    affected: Vec<EntityRef>,                  // (kind, id) pairs
    new_snapshot: Arc<Project>,
    diff_hint: DiffHint,                       // Coarse | Layer(id) | Composition | ...
}
```

`diff_hint` lets consumers do partial work — see [architecture.md](architecture.md) for the IR-compiler contract.

## Validation invariants (enforced inside the actor on every commit)

| Invariant | Failure |
|---|---|
| `t_start_us < t_end_us` | reject |
| `t_start_us >= 0` | clamped in the mutator (a link move stops as a set), then reject as a backstop (`NegativeLayerStart`); a project loaded from disk is repaired in `parseProject` instead of rejected |
| Visual `t_start_us`, `t_end_us`, the composition's `duration_us`, marker `t_us`/`end_t_us` on that composition's frame grid | snap-round (half-up) in the mutator, then reject as a backstop (`OffGridLayerBoundary` / `OffGridTime`); a project loaded from disk is repaired in `parseProject` instead of rejected. Both errors carry `snap_to`, the value the caller should have sent |
| Audio `t_start_us`, `t_end_us` on the fixed 48 kHz sample lattice | same three-site enforcement, against the audio grid; the error carries `grid: "sample"` and `fps: 48000/1` |
| `fps` immutable once the timeline — or any stored snapshot / checkpoint — holds a layer | reject (`FpsLockedByContent`, carrying `locked_by: current \| history`). History scope, because the unrecorded rate change writes to every snapshot: judging on the live state alone would let `undo` resurrect old-grid layers at the new rate. Set the rate on a project whose timeline has never held anything |
| `transition.duration_us` == the geometric overlap of its participants | reject — this *is* the transition's grid rule; a duration is a distance, not a boundary time |
| `0 ≤ src_in_us < src_out_us`, and `src_out_us ≤ media.duration_us` for `VideoClip` / `Audio` | reject. A `CompositionRef` window has **no** upper bound — overhang past the referenced composition's duration is tolerated (ADR 0052 §6) |
| No two layers in the same track overlap in `[t_start, t_end)` | reject (with structured options) |
| Per composition: `duration_us == max(layer.t_end_us)` while `duration_pinned == false` | auto-fit bidirectionally (grow on adds, shrink on deletes/inward trims) |
| Per composition: `duration_us ≥ max(layer.t_end_us)` while `duration_pinned == true` | overflow guard only — pinned value grows if a layer extends past it, never shrinks |
| Per composition: `fps.den > 0`, `width/height > 0` | reject |
| `root_id` is a key of `compositions` | reject (`RootMissing`) |
| `compositions[k].id == k` | reject (`CompositionIdMismatch`) |
| Every `CompositionRef.composition` names an existing composition | reject (`CompositionMissing`) |
| No `CompositionRef` targets `root_id` | reject (`RootReferenced`) |
| Composition references form no cycle | reject (`CompositionCycle { path }`; orphans — compositions nothing references — are legal) |
| A composition is removed only by `groups_ungroup` of its last reference or by `compositions_delete` when unreferenced | reject (`CompositionInUse { composition, ref_count }`). Deleting a Group layer never cascades into its composition — the orphan stays, legal, until `compositions_delete` |
| Every composition's `fps`, `sample_rate`, `channels` equal the root's | reject (`CompositionLatticeMismatch { composition, field }`) |
| `Layer.id` unique across **all** compositions | reject (`DuplicateLayerId`) |
| `Marker.id` unique across **all** compositions | reject (`DuplicateMarkerId`) |
| An anchored marker's `anchor.layer` names a layer of the **same** composition | reject (`MarkerAnchorNotInComposition`) — the two timelines share no origin, so no `t_us` could be derived from a crossing tie |
| An anchored marker's layer carries a source window (`VideoClip` / `Audio` / `CompositionRef`) | reject (`MarkerAnchorLayerHasNoSourceWindow`) — the derivation reads `params.src_in_us` |
| `anchor.src_us` inside the layer's window | **not checked** — outside it is the legal hibernating state (see `Marker`) |
| All references (`MediaId`/`LayerId`/`LinkId`/`TransitionId`) resolve | reject |
| `Link.id` unique within its composition's `links` | reject (`DuplicateLinkId`) |
| Every `Link.members` entry names a layer of the **same** composition | reject (`LinkMemberMissing`) |
| A layer is in at most one link | reject (`LayerInMultipleLinks`) |
| A link holds ≥ 2 members | dissolved in the mutator when a delete or `links_remove_members` takes it below two — delete is local, so this is the only way a member leaves — then reject as a backstop (`LinkBelowMinSize`) |
| A transition's two participants do not share a link | reject at `add_transition` (`TransitionParticipantsShareLink`): placement moves the incoming layer with its link siblings, so a shared link would drag the outgoing layer along and the overlap would never open |
| Keyframe `t_us` outside `[0, layer.duration]` | **allowed** — trim/split intentionally keep out-of-range keys (non-destructive); `value_at` clamps and the UI hides them |
| Motif props match the Motif manifest's `props_schema` | reject |
| `Animated` with empty keyframes ⇔ `Static` | normalize |

A failed invariant returns a structured error to the caller (UI shows toast; MCP returns tool error with a reason and, where useful, suggested alternative actions).

## Mutation surface

Every command reaches agents as an MCP tool, almost always under the same
name. The exceptions are the commands a single tool covers by argument:
`delete_layers` / `ripple_delete_layers` are one `delete_layers { ripple }`,
`attach_marker` / `detach_marker` one `set_marker_anchor { layer_id }`, and
`lock_history` / `unlock_history` one `set_history_lock { locked }`. Patches are
**strongly typed**, not JSON Patch.

**Scope is derived, never passed** (ADR 0052 §3; the invariants table above).
Layer ids are unique across every composition, so a layer-addressed command
locates its layer in whichever composition holds it and edits *that*
composition — its tracks, links, transitions, duration autofit and track
cleanup — with no scope argument; a marker-, track-, link- or
transition-addressed command does the same by its own id (marker ids are
project-wide unique too). Only **creation** commands carry a scope:
`add_track`, `add_marker`, `add_caption_track`, the lane-picking layer adds
and the composition envelope (`set_composition`, `fit_composition_to_layers`)
take `composition_id?`, defaulting to the root; a layer add that names a
`track_id` needs none, because a track lives in exactly one composition.
No command that derives its scope crosses compositions: a destination in
another one (a move's target track, a restack's anchor, a paste's target
lane) is refused with `CrossCompositionMove { layer, from, to }`, and a set
command whose members straddle two compositions (`delete_layers`,
`ripple_delete_layers`, `set_layers_enabled`, `paste_layers`,
`move_layers_to_new_track`, `links_create`, `links_add_members`) with
`CrossCompositionSet { layer,
composition, expected }`. A layer changes composition only through
pre-compose, adding it to an existing Group, ungroup, or
`move_layers_to_composition` — the four ops that name a destination
composition rather than inherit one. Crossing has its own op; a *move* still
never crosses.

The MCP surface mirrors this 1:1 (same names, schemars-derived schemas);
the UI uses the same actor via backend commands.

| Command | Notes |
|---|---|
| `import_media(path)` → `MediaId` | hashes, probes metadata, fans out proxy / thumbnails / waveform jobs |
| `remove_media(id, force?)` | rejects with `MediaInUse { referenced_by }` if any layer references it unless `force=true` |
| `add_track(label?, composition_id?)` → `TrackId` | tracks are kind-agnostic — any layer kind can be placed on any track; lands in the named composition, the root by default |
| `remove_track(id, force?)` | rejects if non-empty unless `force` |
| `move_track(id, new_position)` | |
| `rename_track(id, label?)` | **recorded** (undoable); any track, reserved ones included. A blank or absent `label` stores `None`, which restores the derived name |
| `update_track_flags(id, patch)` | unrecorded; patch any subset of `{enabled, muted, solo, locked}`; undo never reverts these. `muted`/`solo` round-trip but no longer gate audio (mixing is per-role) |
| `set_role_gain(role, gain_db)` | **recorded** (undoable); sets a mixing role's bus gain, folded into that role's layers at mix time |
| `update_role_flags(role, patch)` | unrecorded (like `update_track_flags`); patch `{muted?, solo?}` on a role's mix bus; undo never reverts these |
| `add_color_layer(track_id, t_start_us, t_end_us, color, width?, height?, composition_id?)` → `LayerId` | rejects on overlap; the track fixes the composition, `composition_id` is a cross-check |
| `add_video_layer(track_id, media_id, t_start_us, t_end_us, src_in_us, src_out_us, composition_id?)` → `LayerId` | rejects on overlap; same cross-check |
| `add_motif(motif_id, t_start_us, t_end_us?, track_id?, props?, composition_id?)` → `LayerId` | `t_end_us` defaults to `default_duration_s`; `track_id` auto-creates a fresh track when absent, in `composition_id` (root by default) |
| `apply_subtitles(body, format?, track_id?, t_start_us?, t_end_us?)` | Parses `body` (SRT/VTT/ASS) and lands the cues as editable `Text` layers on the composition's caption-role tracks — packing into the unlocked caption tracks already there where they have room, opening a new caption track only for a cue that collides with all of them (ADR 0070). `format` is sniffed when omitted. `track_id`, `t_start_us`, and `t_end_us` are accepted on the wire for backward compatibility but are ignored — cue timings come from the body, and the lane is the packing's to pick. Advanced ASS tags (karaoke, drawings) are stripped; the tool notes when `simplified=true`. Returns the id of the caption track the first cue landed on. |
| `paste_layers(layer_ids, t_start_us? \| t_offset_us?, target_track_id?)` → `{ clones: [{ source, clone }] }` | the whole-link duplicate, and the only copy command: every clone shifts by the delta the seed (`layer_ids[0]`) travels to `t_start_us`, or by `t_offset_us` directly (exactly one of the two), then snaps on its own lattice; only the seed changes track; any lock or overlap refuses the whole set; two or more clones are linked to each other |
| `set_layers_enabled(layer_ids, enabled)` | sets `enabled` on exactly the layers named — the UI hands it a link's members when the toggle fans out; a locked track refuses the whole set, a layer's own lock does not |
| `update_layer(layer_id, patch)` | envelope-only patch (label, time range, enabled, locked) |
| `update_layer_params(layer_id, patch)` | kind-specific params |
| `update_layer_param_track(layer_id, param_key, track)` / `update_layer_param_tracks(layer_id, entries)` | replace one / several `Animated<f64>` tracks; normalized (frame-snap / sort / dedupe-last-wins / Auto-tangent solve), recorded, rejects empty-keyframed / unknown-param / locked-track |
| `update_param_tracks_multi(entries)` | the cross-**layer** form of the batch above: every `(layer_id, param_key, track)` entry names its own layer, and the whole set is **one** recorded entry however many layers it spans — so one undo reverts the lot. Same normalization and rejections per entry; the scale-link invariant is checked once per distinct layer after every entry has landed, never mid-batch |
| `move_layer(layer_id, new_track_id, new_t_start_us, escape_link?)` | rejects on overlap; link-aware (see `features.md#links`): a fan-out that would touch a locked member rejects whole with `LinkLockedMember` |
| `move_layers_to_composition(layer_ids, to_composition_id, anchor_layer_id, anchor_t_start_us, to_track_id?)` | the move across compositions (ADR 0054; [features.md §Groups](features.md#groups)): the set — one or more layers of ONE composition — leaves it and lands in `to_composition_id`, `anchor_layer_id` at `anchor_t_start_us`, an ABSOLUTE time on the destination's clock, every other member keeping its phase. The root is an ordinary destination. Lanes are assigned per SOURCE track: `to_track_id` omitted bounces to the nearest free lane else spawns, `"spawn"` always takes a fresh one, and a named lane is refused rather than bounced when it is locked or occupied. Both endpoints re-snap at the DESTINATION's rate, so a cross-rate round trip is not identity. Refuses whole before any write: `CrossCompositionSet`, `LayerNotFound`, `CompositionNotFound`, `TrackNotFound`, `TrackLocked`, `GroupLockedMember`, `CompositionCycle`, `LayerOverlap`, and `InvalidArgument` for an empty set, an anchor outside it, a destination the set is already in, or a landing before composition time 0 |
| `move_layers_to_new_track(layer_ids, anchor_layer_id?, t_start_us?)` → `TrackId` | the raise (ADR 0042; [features.md §Tracks](features.md#tracks)): the set — one or more layers of ONE composition — moves onto ONE fresh lane appended at the top of the z-stack, and every source lane the raise emptied is pruned in the SAME entry, so one undo restores clips and lanes together. The landing is optional and its two halves travel together: with both, `anchor_layer_id` lands on `t_start_us` — an ABSOLUTE time, snapped on the anchor's own grid, the set floored at 0 as one body — and every other member holds its phase; with neither, every time is carried verbatim with no re-snap, which is the *Move to a new track* command's shape. Links are untouched: the op moves exactly the layers it is handed. Refuses whole before minting a lane: `LayerNotFound`, `CrossCompositionSet`, `TrackLocked`, and `InvalidArgument` for an empty set, half a landing, or an anchor outside the set |
| `restack_layer(layer_id, anchor_layer_id, position)` | anchored z-reorder: `position` ∈ `"above" \| "below"` the anchor layer's track, resolved at apply time. Sole-occupant mover moves its whole track (identity survives); a shared-track mover splits onto a new track at the target position (emptied source pruned by the usual rule); a role-stamped source never moves. Already-in-place calls are no-ops that record nothing; Audio movers/anchors and self-anchors reject |
| `split_layer(layer_id, at_t_us, escape_link?)` → `(LayerId, LayerId)` | link-aware: a linked pair cuts at ONE frame instant; unlinked Audio keeps sample precision |
| `apply_cut_list(layer_id, keep_ranges)` → `{ surviving_layer_ids, removed, removed_us }` | the rough cut as one verb: split at every keep edge, discard what no range keeps, ripple the holes closed, label the survivors — ONE recorded entry, so one undo restores the clip. Timeline-absolute ranges on the layer's clock; linked partners overlapping a discarded span go in lockstep; off-grid edges refuse with the nearest point. Refuses whole before any write (ripple refusals by name; a list that keeps nothing is `delete_layers`). Rehearses through `dry_run` (tool flag and generic op), ripple included |
| `trim_layer(layer_id, edge, new_t_us, escape_link?)` | `edge` ∈ `"in" | "out"` |
| `delete_layers(layer_ids)` | the cross-**layer** form: one recorded entry however many layers it spans, so one undo restores the lot. Ids are de-duplicated; a locked member rejects the WHOLE batch rather than half-deleting. Takes the id set verbatim — no link fan-out, since selection is what carries a link |
| `ripple_delete_layers(layer_ids)` | agents reach this as `delete_layers { ripple: true }`. `delete_layers` that also **closes** what the set vacated (ADR 0062; [features.md §Ripple delete](features.md#ripple-delete)): each deleted layer's hole is its own footprint clipped to its remaining same-class neighbours on its track, touching holes merge, and every remaining layer starting at or after a hole shifts left by its length on every track of the composition, each on its link-aware lattice (frame when linked to picture, else its own). Anchored markers follow through reconcile; free markers, the playhead and layers starting before a hole stay. A transition whose two participants both move keeps its frame count and has its `duration_us` / `extended_us` re-derived from the landing. Refuses whole before any write: `RippleInsideHole`, `RippleCollision`, `RippleLinkStraddles`, `RippleLockedLayer` / `TrackLocked` (only a layer that would move blocks), `CrossCompositionSet`, and `InvalidArgument` for an empty set |
| `ripple_delete_gap(track_id, s, e)` | closes a selected **gap** (ADR 0069; [features.md §Ripple delete](features.md#ripple-delete)): `[s, e)` must be exactly a gap on `track_id` — free of every layer, `e` where a layer starts, `s` where one ends or `0` — else `GapNotFound { track, s, e }`; nothing is deleted and the closing is `ripple_delete_layers`' with the gap as the one hole (`delete_layers { ripple: true }` to an agent), refusing with the same names. `TrackNotFound` for an unknown lane; `InvalidArgument` for a degenerate span. Recorded as *Closed gap*; one undo |
| `links_create(layer_ids, label?, reassign?)` → `LinkId` | fewer than two distinct ids → `LinkCreateNeedsTwoLayers`; a layer already in another link → `LayerAlreadyLinked` unless `reassign: true`, which moves it over |
| `links_dissolve(link_id)` / `links_add_members(link_id, layer_ids, reassign?)` / `links_remove_members(link_id, layer_ids)` / `links_rename(link_id, label?)` | an unknown `link_id` → `LinkNotFound`; removing a non-member → `LayerNotInLink`; `add_members` shares `links_create`'s `LayerAlreadyLinked` / `reassign` rule |
| `groups_create(layer_ids, label?)` → `{ composition_id, layer_id }` | pre-compose (ADR 0052; [features.md §Groups](features.md#groups)): the set — one or more layers of one composition — moves into a new composition carrying the parent's settings and the reserved single-A-roll skeleton, its former tracks mapped bottom-up onto the A roll, then fresh lanes; a Group layer takes its place at the earliest start on the top-most former lane (the drop strip's fallback on collision). Never partial: a locked member → `GroupLockedMember`, a locked track → `TrackLocked`, before anything moves. Links fully inside move with their ids, a straddling link loses its inside members; transitions between two members move, a straddling one is reconciled away and logged; the markers ANCHORED to a member move with it (their `t_us` re-derived in the child by the same commit), free markers stay |
| `add_group_layer(source_composition_id, track_id, t_start_us, composition_id?)` → `LayerId` | place an existing composition as one more Group layer — the media pool's drag, and the reuse half of ADR 0052 (`groups_create` is the half that makes a composition). Windowed `[0, duration_us)` with an identity transform; the track fixes the destination composition and `composition_id` is a cross-check. Refused before any write, so nothing is created and no layer id is burned: the root → `RootComposition`; a source that already reaches the destination, itself included → `CompositionCycle` naming the loop; an empty source → `InvalidArgument` |
| `groups_add_members(layer_ids, group_layer_id)` | move layers already on a timeline INTO the composition a Group layer shows, keeping the screen position they had. The members and the Group clip must be siblings, and the clip's `params.composition` is the destination; each member lands at `t_start_us − group.t_start_us + group.src_in_us`, so one outside the clip's window arrives outside it and shows as overhang. Delegates to `move_layers_to_composition` for the crossing itself, and keeps only what is its own: `CrossCompositionSet` when the clip is not the members' sibling, `WrongLayerKind` when it is not a `CompositionRef`, and `RootComposition` — which guards a `CompositionRef` pointing at the root, not the root receiving layers |
| `groups_ungroup(layer_id)` | expand a **plain** Group layer in place — identity transform, static opacity 1, no effects, Normal blend; otherwise `GroupNotPlain { reason: transform \| opacity \| effects \| blend_mode }`. Members intersecting `[src_in_us, src_out_us)` copy in at `t + t_start_us − src_in_us`, trimmed to the window with source in/out and keyframes following; members outside are dropped; the composition's tracks become fresh transient lanes at the ref's track index; links and transitions inside carry over under fresh ids; the composition is removed when its last reference goes |
| `groups_rename(composition_id, label?)` | `null` / blank clears back to the derived name; the root → `RootComposition` |
| `compositions_delete(composition_id)` | removes an unreferenced composition; referenced → `CompositionInUse { composition, ref_count }`; the root → `RootComposition` |
| `add_marker(t_us, label, color, end_t_us?, composition_id?)` → `MarkerId` | markers are per composition |
| `update_marker(marker_id, patch)` / `remove_marker(marker_id)` | the marker id names its composition |
| `set_composition(patch, composition_id?)` | never recorded (setup, not editing); canvas (`width`, `height`, `color_space`, `background`) and `duration_us` land on the named composition, root by default; `fps` / `sample_rate` / `channels` are one lattice and cascade to every composition; `fps` refused with `FpsLockedByContent` once the timeline — or any stored snapshot/checkpoint — holds a layer |
| `fit_composition_to_layers(composition_id?)` | clears the named composition's duration pin (root by default) |
| `checkpoint(label)` → `CheckpointId` | |
| `list_checkpoints()` / `restore_checkpoint(checkpoint_id)` | restore clears redo |
| `undo()` / `redo()` | |
| `lock_history(reason)` / `unlock_history()` | freeze undo while a tool batch runs; one MCP tool, `set_history_lock { locked, reason? }` |
| `dry_run(operations)` | applies the batch against a clone; halts at the first validation error; does not commit |
| `replace_state(snapshot)` | for paste/template-instantiation; full validation; resets history |

Keyframe authoring is exposed to agents as a small family of MCP tools —
`get_param_track`, `set_keyframe`, `remove_keyframe`, `retime_keyframe`,
`set_keyframe_easing`, `set_keyframe_tangents`, `smooth_keyframes`,
`set_extrapolation`, `clear_keyframes`, and the low-level `set_param_track`.
These are the one place the surface is **not**
1:1 with a same-named command: they are handler-side helpers that read the
layer, apply a pure transform, and write the whole track back through
`update_layer_param_track`. They expose the keyframe record itself:
`get_param_track` returns, per key, `{ id, t_us, t_local_us, value, in, out,
continuity, segment, preset_id? }` plus the track's `extrapolate`, and
`set_param_track` takes the same shape; `set_keyframe_easing` writes the
segment leaving a key (`this.out`, `next.in`, `this.segment`, both sides
Free); `set_keyframe_tangents` writes one key's sides and continuity;
`smooth_keyframes` sets Auto on the key(s) it names; `set_extrapolation`
writes the track's `extrapolate`. Keyframe times
in / out are timeline-absolute (converted to layer-local at the boundary).
The transform math is shared with the timeline UI and locked Rust↔TS by a
golden fixture. See [`mcp.md`](mcp.md).

## On-disk format: workspace folder

The workspace folder *is* the project. Opening a workspace folder = opening the project; zipping the folder = backing up the project. Originals get copied in on import so the bundle is self-contained.

```
<workspace>/
├── project.json              ← canonical state, auto-saved 500ms-debounced
├── view.json                 ← UI-only view state for THIS project (below)
├── Media/                    ← imported originals (workspace owns the bytes)

```

**Authoritative path is `MediaItem.path_rel`** (relative to the workspace root). At load time `io::load_from_dir` rewrites `path_abs` as `workspace.join(path_rel)` so moving the workspace folder between machines doesn't break references. `path_abs` is kept in the struct as a convenience for the IR compiler + jobs that read media by absolute path.

`Backups/` rolls every 50 commits or 5 minutes (whichever first), retains the 20 most recent. `project_save_as` is gone in favor of the auto-save subscriber; Cmd-S is a force-flush hook reserved for future UI. The save model is "the folder is the truth" — closing the app loses nothing.

### `view.json`: how this project was last looked at

Sitting beside `project.json` and deliberately **not** part of it: zooming a
timeline must not dirty the document, push an undo entry, or appear on the MCP
tool surface. One definition, `src/shared/view-state.ts`, shared by the main
process (which owns the file) and the renderer (which owns the live copy).

```ts
interface ViewState {
  composition_tabs: CompositionTabView[]   // tab ORDER is this array's order
  active_composition_id: string | null     // the tab that last held the keyboard
  preview_render_target_id: string | null  // null = follow focus
  track_heights: Record<TrackId, number>   // project-wide: a track id names its composition
  expanded_tracks: TrackId[]               // keyframe sub-lanes; absent ⇒ collapsed
}

interface CompositionTabView {
  composition_id: string
  anchor_layer_id: string | null   // the Group clip this tab was entered through
  px_per_sec: number               // this composition's own zoom
  scroll_left_px: number
}
```

`composition_tabs` is an **intent**, not the Panel list: the timeline Panels
that exist are this list intersected with the compositions the summary carries
(ADR 0053). An entry therefore outlives the undo that removed its composition,
and the redo brings the tab back with its zoom, scroll and anchor intact. Only
the last step of an anchor is stored — the rest of the path follows from the
project — and `null` means the tab was opened by id and takes the shortest path
from the root.

`viewStateDefaults()` is the SINGLE place a missing field gets a value. A field
added here and left `undefined` reaches the renderer as a blank screen, so every
reader goes through the defaults rather than through a local `?? …`.

The Dock's own geometry is not here. It is app-level
([below](#app-level-storage-the-data-root)), and the seam between the two
documents is what keeps a composition id out of a file that spans every project.

## App-level storage: the data root

Everything above is **per-project** — it lives inside the workspace folder and
travels with it. Orthogonal to that is **app-level** storage: state and large
assets that belong to the installation, not to any one project. This splits in
two, by whether the user should be able to relocate it.

**Small config/state + secrets stay in `<userData>/`** (Electron's per-user app
data dir), each an atomically-written JSON owned by the TS main process:
`app_settings.json`, `keybindings.json`, `workspaces.json`, `recents.json`,
`decode_capability.json`, and the secrets `cloud_keys.json` / `mcp_auth.json`
(plus the OS keyring). These are tiny and their location is fixed — the data
root's own path has to live somewhere the resolver can read before anything
else, so it cannot itself live under the data root (bootstrap chicken-and-egg).

`workspaces.json` holds Dock layouts: the current arrangement plus every saved
profile. **No composition id may ever be written into it** — it spans every
project, so a profile carrying one project's uuids would make "reset to my
layout" mean different things in different projects. A timeline Panel is
addressed `timeline:<compositionId>` while it is live, and every one of them
folds back to the bare `timeline` slot on serialization, which records where the
timeline row sits and how large it is and nothing else. Restore runs in that
order: geometry first, the root's timeline in the slot, then the remaining tabs
from the project's `view.json` (ADR 0053). The fold is also why no layout
snapshot version moves for this: the persisted shape is unchanged.

**Large, app-managed, relocatable content lives under a single user-configurable
DATA ROOT**, default `<userData>/data/`, with a fixed internal layout WeftCut
owns:

```
<dataRoot>/            default: <userData>/data  (any absolute path via setting)
├── motifs/            user-authored Motifs (see motifs.md) — user content, not regenerable
├── cache/             the backend's app-level (cross-project) cache — regenerable
└── downloads/         app-managed downloaded content — user content, not regenerable
```

`<dataRoot>/downloads/` holds content the app downloads on the user's behalf
(ADR 0039/0043/0055: speech engines + models and the Qwen3-VL set on Windows).
Layout is `downloads/<itemId>/<version>/…` with a `manifest.json` written last
as the install-complete marker; the catalog of downloadable items (pinned URLs
+ SHA-256 + byte counts) is `src/shared/content-catalog.ts`, the per-item
lifecycle is `src/main/contentDownload.ts` (pure, fs/http-injected), and the
main-owned queue that runs items one at a time is `src/main/contentQueue.ts`
(ADR 0061); the renderer only enqueues, cancels, and renders over the
`content:*` IPC family. In-flight partials live under `cache/content-partial/`
as `<itemId>.part` plus a `<itemId>.part.json` sidecar naming the artifact the
bytes belong to — that sidecar is what lets a drop, a cancel, or a quit resume
from the on-disk size instead of restarting. The pending queue itself is
`cache/content-queue.json`, re-enqueued at boot. Both are regenerable by
definition, so the migration below never copies a torn download.

`<dataRoot>/cache/` is the **app-level** backend cache (the second argument to
the `Backend` constructor). Do not confuse it with the per-project
`<workspace>/Cache/` above — that one holds a project's proxies/thumbnails/
waveforms and is deleted with the project; this one is global to the install and
regenerable. Nesting it here also retires a long-standing collision: it used to
be `<userData>/Cache`, the exact path Chromium uses for its own disk cache
(`<sessionData>/Cache`, and `sessionData` defaults to `userData`). Chromium's
cache is deliberately left where it is; the collision is gone simply because the
backend cache moved under the data root.

A single seam, `apps/desktop/src/main/dataRoot.ts` (`resolveDataRoot`), resolves
the root **once, early at boot** — before the `Backend`, the `UserMotifStore`,
and the fs guard are constructed — from a `data_root` field in
`app_settings.json`, and exposes `{ dataRoot, motifsDir, cacheDir, downloadsDir }`.
Every consumer takes its path from the seam; nothing string-joins `userData` for
these buckets. The resolved root is also admitted to the renderer's `fs:*` guard
allow-list (`isAllowed`, alongside `temp` / `userData` / the active workspace),
since it can live outside `userData`.

Resolution rules:

- `data_root` unset/empty → default `<userData>/data`, created silently.
- set + available (creatable **and** write-probed) → used as-is.
- set + unavailable (unmounted drive, revoked permission, deleted path) → a
  **blocking native dialog** (main window not up yet) offering **Re-set** (native
  folder picker; the choice is persisted and used for this boot) or **Quit**.
  Never a silent fallback — a user who deliberately placed data elsewhere makes a
  conscious choice rather than landing in an empty default library.

### Changing the data root

Relocation is offered from Settings → "Data location" and is a first-class,
verified migration (core: `apps/desktop/src/main/dataRootMigration.ts`, pure +
fs-injected; IPC glue on the `dataRoot:*` channels). Semantics: **copy, preserve
original, verify, roll back, prompt-to-delete-after-success.**

1. The user picks a folder. If it is already a valid WeftCut data root
   (`motifs/`+`cache/`+`downloads/` present), it is **adopted as-is** — no copy,
   no merge. Otherwise the migration **copies** into it.
2. Copy `motifs/` and `downloads/` (source read-only; originals untouched);
   `cache/` is **not** copied — the new root gets an empty `cache/` that refills
   naturally. Nested source/target picks are rejected (self-overwrite guard).
3. **Verify** — Motifs by content hash (reusing `motif/contentHash`), downloads
   by file count + size.
4. **On failure → roll back** exactly what the run created at the new root; the
   old root is never touched and `data_root` is left unchanged. No data loss.
5. **On success** → write `data_root`, then relaunch (`app.relaunch()`) to apply
   (the root is fixed early at boot; a live swap would rebuild too much).
6. A userData-resident marker (`data-root-migration.json`, which survives the
   switch) carries the old path across the relaunch. After the app comes back up
   on the new root, Settings offers to delete the old copy — **only in copy mode**
   (in adopt mode nothing was copied, so the old root is the user's separate prior
   library, never proposed for deletion). Deletion is explicit-confirm-only and
   never removes `userData` itself; "Keep" is a one-time dismiss that clears the
   marker.

This data-root *change* flow is a separate thing from project-schema migration
(§Versioning) — different unit, different trigger. Where the repo says "no
migration" it means **pre-v1 on-disk formats**: `.vproj` folders written by
pre-release builds are refused, not carried forward.

## Versioning

`project.json` embeds a `schema_version: u32`. `SCHEMA_VERSION`
(`state/model.ts`) is the single home for the number and is bumped
whenever the on-disk shape changes incompatibly. Rust deserializes whole
projects but holds no constant and never gates on the value — the field's
doc comment in `native/src/state/project.rs` records that.

The load path is a **version-keyed upgrade chain** (ADR 0047):

1. `state/persistence.ts` refuses what the build cannot read — a
   missing/non-numeric version, or one *ahead* of the build (that file may
   carry fields this binary would drop on the next save).
2. `state/migrate.ts` walks an older file forward through one `v_n → v_n+1`
   step per generation. The runner writes `schema_version` after each step
   and works on a clone, so a step that throws leaves the caller holding
   the original bytes.
3. `state/serialize.ts` (`parseProject`) then casts and normalizes. Its own
   version-equality check is a post-condition on the walk, not the
   user-facing error.

Upgrading happens **in memory**. `project.json` is rewritten by the normal
autosave on the first edit, and when the chain runs the open first copies
the original bytes to `project.pre-v{n}.json` beside it (never into
`Backups/`, whose snapshots are post-write and gc'd), reporting the upgrade
as a status-log row.

### Where a change belongs

| Kind of change | Where it goes |
|---|---|
| A new **optional** field | Additive: `#[serde(default)]` on the Rust side, and a default in `parseProject`'s normalize pass so no consumer ever sees `undefined`. No version bump. |
| A **validity repair** (off-grid geometry, a flag contradicting its own data) | The same version-blind normalize pass. Idempotent, carries no version. |
| A **shape conversion** — field renamed, merged, split, retyped; an enum variant retired | A step in the chain, with a version number. **Never** an unconditional rewrite in `parseProject`. |

That third row is a rule, not a preference: three conversions once rode the
blind pass because the cut-over gate left no alternative, and the on-disk
shape drifted across three generations while the version sat still. ADR 0047
has the history.

The current schema is **v1, unreleased**, with an empty migration chain. There
are no released projects to support. Shape changes, including the explicit
`position: { mode: "XY", x, y }` / Path record, cut over in place and refresh
the current v1 fixture. Legacy direct transform axes are refused, not migrated.
ADR 0060 removes the initially added v1 → v2 compatibility step. The versioned
chain and its synthetic tests remain ready for the first post-release change;
the rules above apply once a released format needs preservation.

A step imports **nothing** — not `SCHEMA_VERSION` (the target version is a
parameter), not a model type, not `defaultSettings()`. It takes the wire
object, declares local types for the fields it touches, and writes frozen
literals; otherwise it silently re-anchors to a model that has moved on, and
the failure only ever appears on a real user's old file.

Be permissive at deserialization (unknown fields are ignored) so a binary can
load projects authored by a slightly newer binary within the same version —
the unknown fields drop on next save.

### Bumping `SCHEMA_VERSION`

A bump ships **in the same change** as its migration step and a frozen fixture
of the version it leaves behind (`fixtures/projects/v{n}.json`, frozen from
the moment a step reads it — see that directory's README). `migrate.completeness.test.ts`
fails otherwise: it pins `MIN_SCHEMA_VERSION + STEPS.length ===
SCHEMA_VERSION`, that the steps sit at exactly the versions in between, and
that every fixture still upgrades and passes `parseProject` + `validate`.

## Pitfalls

1. **Float-time bugs.** Never round-trip `t_start_us` through `f64` except at API boundaries. One `as f64 / 1_000_000.0` and back loses precision near the hour mark.
2. **Layer-overlap rule cuts both ways.** When the agent says "add this clip from t=5 to t=10" and there's already content at t=7, the API must return a structured error with options ("create new track" / "trim existing" / "abort"), not a brick-wall reject.
3. **`media_pool` cleanup.** Don't auto-remove a `MediaItem` when its last reference goes away — the user might be mid-edit. Mark unreferenced; sweep on save with consent.
4. **`enabled: false` ≠ deleted.** Disabled layers still serialize, still occupy their time range for layout. Agents will toggle these for A/B variations.
5. **Keyframes are relative.** Document this prominently — it's the kind of bug that bites once and forever.
6. **A `SCHEMA_VERSION` bump without its migration step** is the one mistake here that cannot be repaired after the fact — a chain added later cannot rescue files already written. The step and the frozen fixture ship in the same change; `migrate.completeness.test.ts` is what makes that mechanical (§Versioning).
6. **Schema migrations under MCP.** Including `schema_version` in every resource response is the simplest defense; agents holding `project://` reads then adapt.
7. **Motif raster invalidation.** Patch `MotifParams.props`
   field-wise rather than replacing whole `params` — otherwise the
   raster cache thrashes on every prop tweak.
